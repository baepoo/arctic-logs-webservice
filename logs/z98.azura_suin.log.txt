*Yay! You see a half-naked spice girl. She stands helplessly, holding a
*polished spiked club in her hands, that seem to be very tired of this.
*She looks at you with a strange sadomasochystic interest.  Maybe you
*want to help her with her ... CLUB? Watching her you began to dream: her
*slim hands hug you, her lips start kissing you to death and finally ...
*You are awaken, she looks at you with a sad, bored face without ANY
*interest. Sure, you're NOT the man of her dreams :P
