Xanitha spammed me to log on because some Fury clan members were murder
flagged and her and some other friends trapped in the Kalaman inn. I logged
my thief and ran to Kalaman. I stabbed a few bad guys in the inn, but they
fled away to their grouping waiting north. Log picks up right after we move
north out of the inn, where I missed a stab on Tiel(who later told me he has
25 dex). Xanitha was *supposed* to entry haste our bashers, but forgot,
choosing to prism instead! Notice Kalle, the evil level 1, running in to
loot. Kalle, AKA Zezzogamu, Tiina, Mika, Abuse_of_Game_Mechanics_Finn!
