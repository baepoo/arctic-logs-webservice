Kir rip

POV: Iill

Log Rating: 2.0000

The day prior to this, Kir had led an ambush attempt on us in sanction.
But apparently, he was "just leading a zone".

A hill giant arrives from the north.
The Road to Solace
The trees that line the route give a good indication of the ways to
travel. To the north the huge vallenwood trees of Solace are visible,
clearly marking the southern entrance to the town. The road to the
south
becomes wild and rocky as it leads through a wilder section of forest.

On a Long Road
The dense forest around you occasionally places obstacles in your path,
you cannot help but trip and fall. Fortunately the soft cushion of dead
leaves offers much help. Weak sounds of the hustle and bustle of town
life
can be heard from the north. The road continues to the south, it seems
as
if it could go on forever.

becomes open and dusty, while to the north large vallenwood trees make
up
the tree village of Solace.

Various animals and insects inspect you as you wearily tread this rocky

and
it would be wise to carefully watch your possessions. The road
continues in
a north-south direction.

On a Long Road
The tiredness in your legs suggest you have been travelling far too
long and a rest is in order. This road could go on forever. To the
south
can be seen a small wooden shack by the side of the road. To the north,
the
great vallenwoods of Solace can just be made out. Darkenwood extends
out to
to your west and rumors of exotic woodland spirits excite you somewhat.

On a Road
The road continues, snaking through the rocky wilderness. It makes a
large curve to avoid a big boulder, jutting out from the surrounding
hills.
You have heard tales of bandits surviving off of travellers on the
roadways
of Krynn, and it occurs to you that this would be an excellent spot for
an
ambush. The road continues to the north and south.

By a Small Hovel
Wearily, you come to stop outside a small hovel. It looks like it has
been built as a rest stop to provide a safe haven for travellers. The
hovel
sits off to the west of the main road here. The road itself stretches
out
to the north and east. The terrain to the east is becomes dry and
dusty,
while you can see what appears to be a forest on the edge of the plains
to
the north.

A Small Hovel
This is the interior of a small hovel. There are a few crude bunks and
a small table. A firepit is in the center of the hovel, presumably used
for
cooking. Wooden shutters cover the small windows and there is a small
bar
used to lock the door to the hovel. These appear to be the only
precautions
taken against highway robbers and other assorted bandits. The small
door
exits to the east.

The road continues, now heading to the south. The general terrain seems

addition,
the air seems to be getting somewhat colder. From a nearby hill, a deer
notices you, and bolts into the woods. From here, the road continues to
the
