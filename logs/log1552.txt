A Secret Magic Shop
One does not have to be very bright to quickly realize the items in
this room are magic. It is likely that which is the reason that this
room
is hidden as well as it is. The Solamnics, highly distrustful of magic,
would not tolerate the working of magic within the confines of their
city

racks
filled with potions and scrolls, all of which are spellbound by the
master
and cannot be moved. A stone desk rests in the corner, a small candle
burning quietly atop it.

The room is quite cozy, arranged with a few large tables and
comfortable chairs around them. It also seems very quiet in here,
perhaps a
magical spell was laid on the room so that those who used it could
study
their craft without distraction. The walls are nearly covered with
bookcases that are filled with many types of books that magi would find
useful. A soft white light emanates from the ceiling, but you do not
see
the source.

An overpowering smell greets those that enter this small shop. The
smell appears to come from the racks and racks of herbs throughout the
shop. The herbs grow in all shapes, sizes, and colors, ranging from
sphagnum moss to dragon herb (similar to wolfbane, only different.)
Skylights in the roof above you allow light to pass to the plants
during
the daytime, warming the moist, stagnant air. In the back corner of the
shop sits a black pot on a stove and a foul smell emanating from it.

Triumvirate
Many houses of Vingaard's middle-class families stand on the north and
south sides of this road as it passes east-west through the
southwestern
section of Vingaard. Most of the houses are made of stone, and are one
to
two stories tall. Short stone paths lead to the wooden front doors of
the
houses, with a few plants along its sides. Entrance to nearly all of
the
houses is prevented by gates that have been locked and barred, except
to
the south where the gate stands open. An array of small plants grows in
the
garden to the south, and the house appears to belong to a herbalist.

Avenue of the Triumvirate
The cobblestone lanes of Southern Avenue and The Avenue of the
Triumvirate intersect here. The edifices along the northern side of the
Avenue of the Triumvirate are larger and grander than the buildings
along
the southern side, apparently because they serve a greater function
than
the houses that populate the street on the south side. The famed Temple
of
Paladine stands to the northeast, and another large stone building
stands
to the northwest. The central park is visible a bit to the north.
A cityguard marches down the street, keeping a vigilant eye for danger.

The cobblestone avenue heads north and south here, where it extends for
quite a distance. The gates to the central park of Vingaard rise high
into
the sky just to the north, while the famed Temple of Paladine stands to
the
east. Cobblestones beneath your feet are round and worn from the nearly
constant usage. Amazingly, they still fit tight and snug after
centuries.
The city stretches out far in all directions. To the south, houses of
all
types are visible, while large buildings are visible across the park to
the
north.
63H 127V 7513768X 10740C Mem:10 Exits:NS> nSouthern Avenue and Garrison
Street
The heart of the city, Garrison Street appears to be a quite popular
place to be during the daylight hours. Various stalls are spread out
along
the street, each with a skilled artisan selling its creations. A brick
wall
covered with vines and flowers sits on the northern edge of the street.
To
the north, green vines climb over and through the bars of the fence
surrounding the park, preventing one from seeing clearly into the park,
while providing a sense of privacy to those in the park.
63H 126V 7513768X 10740C Mem:10 Exits:NESW> eGarrison Street
Named for the establishment that once stood here at the time of the
city's foundation, Garrison Street now serves as a venue for artisans
to
sell their crafts. The center of the city, this street seems to be a
very
popular place to pass the time during the daylight hours. The famed
Temple
of Paladine stands to the south, its large platinum doors resting
solemnly,
and a vine covered brick wall runs the length of the road on the north
side. A light, sweet smell seems to drift towards your nose from the
flowers on the vines.
A wooden stall with a table sits here for artisans to display their
wares on.
63H 125V 7513768X 10740C Mem:10 Exits:ESW> sEntrance to the Temple of
Paladine
Twin staircases of white marble descend to the north and south, meeting
the roads that run parallel to the ancient structure. Gates of crafted
platinum stand to the east, the symbols of the great God Paladine upon
them. The white marble of the columns, walls, and roofs all show signs
of
heavy weathering, a result of the neglect and abandonment suffered in
the
years after the cataclysm. Though neglected, the temple does not appear
to
have been vandalized. A small garden blossoms to the west, while the
gates
lead within the temple.
A pigeon walks about pecking the ground and running from your feet.
63H 124V 7513768X 10740C Mem:10 Exits:NES> eThe Temple of Paladine
Aged white marble rises up around and over your head as you pass
through this small archway between the main temple and its gates. The
arches are spaced approximately ten feet apart, square, and they ascend
the
walls then crisscross above. Words have been carved into the walls,
however
they are of a unknown language, their meaning lost to time. Torches
placed
upon the arches provide lighting for this passage.
63H 123V 7513768X 10740C Mem:5 Exits:EW> eBeneath the Temple's Dome
You stand beneath the beautiful white marble dome at the center of the
temple. The walls stretch high above you, and seem to bend and curl as
they
make their way to the dome's center. The room is circular in shape, and
all
of it is made from white marble. The floor is smooth and beautiful, but
its
age shows clearly. Torches mounted along the walls burn quietly,
providing
ample light for the large room. A large statue of a platinum dragon,
dedicated to the god Paladine, stands in the center of the room.
An adventurer, new to Vingaard, searches for an inn or a tavern.
A young acolyte of Paladine is here, cleaning the temple.
A street sweeper stands here, sweeping up dirt and trash.
63H 122V 7513768X 10740C Mem:5 Exits:NESW> eThe Head Priestess' Office
A large stone table rests in the center of this room, one of only a few
objects visible. Graying parchment rests on the surface of the table,
instructions and notes scrawled over them. The room is nearly empty
aside
from the table and a few candles that provide dim lighting. The air
hangs
with a strange sensation, one of sadness, but a sadness brightened by
hope
for the future.
