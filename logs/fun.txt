Message  3 (Fri Sep 15): Dorian          -- Hell
----------
Well it seems the Balifor Patrol was forcefully retired.
Just when we were about to get some good equipment. Shows what 4 under
10th level players can do to make sure balifor is safe for the world.

We meant you no harm:
Shang
Nevin
Miriya
Thurgl
etc.

But you did not pay the Balifor Patrol Toll so you were dealt a ace of
spades by the Balifor Patrol.  Next time just pay us.

Amen.

Balifor patrol:
Jericho (The paladin turned warrior at level 6)
Dorian (the warrior turned 4th level from 6th)
Mortis (just look at his name- he is feared)

 [return for more, q to stop]Sunas (who is this guy? hahah only we know)
Swank (Missed the best part didn't you?)

that be it my friends. welcome to hell btw.
