Sarah vs wizard eye

POV: Fidlas

Log Rating: 1.1817

Lady Sarah Meddaugh, Black Mage of Mysidia is standing here, fighting a
wizard eye.

WIZARD EYE: Sarah teleports in.

Romis' Refuge
This seems to be the most lavish room that you have been in. The room
is draped in expensive furniture. Several small busts of famous Krynn
warriors line the eastern wall, their eyes all gazing at the center of
the
room. In the center of the room, there is a large, finely-crafted desk.
Studying the room some more, you notice several paintings of the great
minotaur king, Bul. The room has a nice, pleasant smell to it in
general.
The corpse of Romis is lying here.
The corpse of an elite guard is lying here. [2]

Before the Great Doors
With the howl of the storm still in the air, you approach a set of
large marble doors. The doors have been chiseled from some of the
finest
marble on Krynn, leaving you with a sense that there is not only power
in
this Keep, but also immense wealth. There is a large, black lily
engraved
into the doors, it's stem entwined around the handle of a battle axe.
The corpse of a Warrior of the Lily is lying here. [2]
325H 172V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NS> The Descending Corridor
This section of the corridor is much damper and colder than the rest of
the Keep. The candles on the wall have long since been removed, as the
gale
winds which blow in from the missing section of the western wall makes
it
impossible to maintain them. The wind and rain pelt down on you here as
if
you were outdoors, tearing away at your very soul. You notice that a
single
candle has been left in it's holder, but no flame burns on its damp
wick.
The corridors to the north and south seem much calmer and dryer,
enticing
you to quickly leave this section.
325H 171V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NS> I see no door to the west.
325H 171V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NS> The Training Hall
This appears to be the training room of the Keep. It seems rather
well-kept. Gazing around, you notice that the floor is covered with
several
spots of dried blood. There is a large, oak cabinet with the symbol of
the
Lily set into the northern walling. By the size of the room, and the
many
blood stains and shattered weapons which lie strewn about, you realize
that
this is the training ground of the elite knights of the Keep.
The corpse of a Knight of the Lily is lying here. [3]

Outside the Keep
This path, while not protected by the stone walls of the keep, appears
to be scarcely affected by the storm which protects the keep. While you
can
see the effects of the storm, you feel only a moderately strong breeze.
The
path continues to what appears to be the stables to the north, and back
into the mighty fortress to the east. A path leads around the keep to
the
south.
325H 169V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NES> s
A Path Around the Keep
You can hear the clanging of metal, coming from a source a short
distance away to the north. High above, embedded into the corner formed
by
the walls of theh keep, is a small platform, though you see no way to
access it. It appears to be some sort of guard station.
The corpse of a dragonrider captain is lying here.
The corpse of a large red dragon is lying here.

A Path Around the Keep
The path around the keep is anything but spectacular. The ground shows
signs of heavy usage and the walls of the keep rise to the east. The
storm
rages to the west, but you feel nothing on this path. This part of the
path
is pretty much the same as the rest of the path.
Wicked looking black leg plates rest in a heap here...it glows blue
A breast plate is lying on the ground.
A tin hooded lantern has been left here.
325H 167V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:ES> s
A Path Around the Keep
This path seems to be the main route of transportation for the soldiers
of the keep that train in the courtyard. The stone floor showns signs
of
usage from humans and horses, as well as dragons. Lightning flashes off
in
the distance, reminding you of the storm that rages around this island.

A Path Around the Keep
This path appears to be used heavily. It seems that the front gates of
Storms Keep is used as rarely as possible. The massive walls of the
keep
rise to the east, towering high above you. Looking around you note that
the
storm that rages around the keep seems to have no effect on the keep or
its
inhabitants.
A hideous skull grins evilly at you.
A breast plate is lying on the ground. [2]

The Inner Courtyard
This area of the courtyard appears to be empty, although you feel eyes
watching you. To the south is a huge wall, with a single archway
leading
back into the courtyard. The archway serves as a choke point; it would
be
an excellent tool to use in preparing an ambush. A path extends to the
west, appearing to lead around the keep.
325H 164V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:(N)SW> s
A Guard Station
This guard station serves as a buffer between the outer courtyard and
the main keep. There is a small archway in the northern wall, and the
courtyard extends in all other directions. The archway serves as a
choke
point: all access to the main keep passes through this station. If the
keep
were to be attacked, the intruders would have to pass through this arch
as
well, making it an excellent location for an ambush.

The Center of the Courtyard
The tiled stone floor here is scuffed and scratched from excessively
high volumes of traffic. A large stone fountain lies in the very center
of
the courtyard, offering refreshment to the knights as they train. There
are
three stone benches surrounding the fountain, offering the training
knights
a chance to rest before recommencing their training.
A large, black fountain juts up in the middle of the market.

Courtyard in the Keep
A constant veil of darkness is thrown over the courtyard of the keep
caused by the clouds of the storm which always surrounds the keep. The
large courtyard is over crowded with novices and knights in training.
Few
take notice of you, most disregarding you as more spies from the
continent.
The courtyard extends in nearly all directions before you, and further
north you can see the main keep. Looking around you, you can't help but
think that the keep could never be taken in a frontal assault, perhaps
if
Krynn had known of this threat earlier...

At the Great Gate of Storm's Keep
Looming before you are the great adamantite gates of Storm's Keep.
Detailing of lilies and borders of thorns accent the otherwise bland
doors.
Flanking the dark metal gates are high walls of blackened stone worn
smooth
by the constant beating of the rain. The wicked wind whips about your
face
wreathing about your body and chilling you to the bone. Lining the top
of
the wall are a couple of uninterested soldiers and a pair of stone
guardians, shaped like dragons and carved to resemble the living. The
overall affect is quite frightening and it puts an awkward weight upon
your
shoulders and quickens the already rapid beat of your heart.
325H 159V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NS> s
The Path of Puddles
Harsh winds and piercing rain pummels you as you make your way along
this path. The path itself is more like a shallow river that leads
north,
towards what you assume would be the keep. Through the dense fog and
the
constant barrage of rain blurring your vision you can see the large
gates
to the keep a short distance off to your north. You hasten your steps,
hoping to get out of this storm, either by forcing your way into the
shelter of the keep, or by letting yourself get captured.
A small key of carved ebony lies here.

A Curious Landing
A large, smooth chunk of rock juts out from the island here overlooking
the swirling and churning ocean. The landing seems quite safe and
appears
to be one of the favorite unloading spots for people coming to and from
the
island. Through the swirling mist and pounding rain you can barely make
out
the faint outline of a vast and dark keep to your north. It is hard to
get
a good focus on the keep from this vantage due to the strange weather
that
seems to have gripped the isle. There seems to be a path leading north
from
here.
