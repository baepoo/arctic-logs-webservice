Here it is - the downfall of the shortest overlord reign in history. Bunge
bites the dust over (unconfirmed) dislike and falling out with Fistandantilus
about Sophitia.

Scene of a Perfect Crime [7] INDOORS PRIVATE NO_TELEPORT NOWARN
     You are in the most glorious room you have seen.  The walls are
constructed of granite.  Bas-reliefs cover the walls with images of the
many battles and experiences of the Great Horus and his parents, Isis and
Osiris.  Upon the walls are images of various gods, serving under (and
sometimes along side) Horus.  An absolutely awe-inspiring image of Nut is
engraved and painted on the ceiling.
Fistandantilus, the Dark One is standing here. (invis 31)

645H>rofl
You roll on the floor in a fit of laughter.

645H>say I don't even want to know - but I think I know why.
You say 'I don't even want to ask - but I think I know why.'

645H>
Fistandantilus nods solemnly.

645H> say I guess you are unretired again
You say 'I guess you are unretired again'

645H>
Fistandantilus says 'afraid so'

645H> grin
You grin evilly.

645H>say ok, well, you might be busy in the next while, going to laugh about
this with andy
You say 'ok, well, you might be busy in the next while, going to laugh about
this with
andy'

645H>goto 31500
Thorvald's Ronkum-Stronkum Ski Emporium [31500] NOSUMMON COLD TEMPLE GOD_ONLY LI
BRARY GROVE NO_TELEPORT LIGHT
    As you look about you, you begin to realize that this room is used more
for watching Warren Miller movies, and daydreaming about skiing than for
actually testing anything useful. Huge posters of a scarred, and battle
worn dwarf attempting to ski adorn the walls. You can only assume that they
are vain pictures of the great Thorvald himself!
Thorvald Hankuvor is standing here. (invis 32)

645H Exits E>say Bwahahahahahahah!!!!
You say 'Bwahahahahahahah!!!!'

645H Exits:E>
Thorvald throws back his head and cackles with insane glee!

645H Exits:E>say that was funny, never seen Dale use all caps before'
You say 'that was funny, never seen Dale use all caps before'
