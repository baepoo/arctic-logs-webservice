Hy R.I.P.

POV: Vargus

Log Rating: -1.3750

Well, your moment in the sun didn't last long Hy. Might wanna look
before you dive next time.

Intersection of Hurin Avenue and Phren Lane
The two causeways of Delphon intersect in the center of the town. The
dry wind picks up the dust, choking the throat as its inhaled. The once
prosperous town spreads out in all directions. To the northwest, the
old
warehouse district seems to have been converted into the barracks for
the
Green Dragonarmy troops stationed here. The bright colors of the bazaar
fill the area to the southeast. The great black granite structure of
the
Temple of the Condor takes up the southwest section of the city, while
the
once famous cacti gardens stand to the northeast. Hurin runs north and
south, while Phren connects the two main gates of the city.

Phren Lane
This is a good vantage point from which to observe the expanse of
Delphon. The dry wind continues to buffet everyone, but this slightly
wider
section of Phren Lane allows one to get out of the main flow of
traffic.
Just east of here is the primary intersection of the city where the two
arterial streets cross in an often wild dance of alternating
directions. A
considerable distance to the east and west lie the main gates of the
city
which rise up to form daunting defensive structures.
