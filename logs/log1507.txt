fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there
is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

Beyond the City of Kalaman
Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two
paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off

fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there
is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.
