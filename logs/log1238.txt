Curving Away from the Shore
The trail here heads towards the shoreline of the river, and into the
plains south of here. The river stretches out a little ways north of
you as
it makes its way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in
with
sandy dunes. Scattered among the dunes are pieces of driftwood that
have
been washed up over the years from storms off the ocean.
