A Secret Room
Magic courses through your body as you enter the room. The room looks
like nothing, but yet everything all at once. The faces of old friends
and
people long since moved away greet you. From what you can tell, the
room is
a giant portal. Apparently the high druid constructed this room using
the
power of nature to travel through space. Whether it was made for the
evacuation of the elves or as a last chance escape method for himself,
you
are unable to tell. Now all that is left for you to solve is how to use
it.
