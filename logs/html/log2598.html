		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of<br />

alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the<br />
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and<br />
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on<br />
the tavern wall.<br />

A Dark Alley<br />
    The alley runs parallel with traders street, and is really nothing more<br />
than a gutter between the tall buildings of Cannery Row and High Street.<br />
The narrow, unlit alley is obviously used as a shortcut between the two.<br />

shadows catch your eye. As you move along, you realize that your ears are<br />
ringing because you are listening so hard.<br />

Cannery Row<br />
    The road continues a short way to the east here, then dead-ends. An<br />
alley extends into darkness to the south, and the road continues to the<br />
west. The road is a mixture of packed dirt and mud, and you must put forth<br />
some effort to keep your clothing from becoming soiled.<br />

Cannery Row<br />
    The smell here is less than delightful, to be sure. The aroma of<br />
rotting fish entrails makes you want to gag, and you decide you should<br />
leave the area as quickly as possible. You are happy that you have chosen<br />
the life of an adventurer instead of that of someone who works here.<br />

This is the beginning of Cannery Row, home to the many fisheries and<br />
canning warehouses that have sprung up in Balifor. To your north and south<br />

Traders Street<br />
    The narrow trading street continues to the north, where it leads to the<br />
docks that provide the town with its revenue. The cry of seabirds is<br />
carried on the sea breeze. The occasional flash of white in the sky<br />
confirms the presence of gulls. To the west lies Guild Road, where<br />
adventurers of many guilds can find training in their arts.<br />
