		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

The Reception<br />
     This is the reception of the lodge, where you would sign in for a<br />
room. This is also a very popular place where adventurers sit around and<br />
share tales of their journeys. Some stairs in the back lead up to the<br />
quarters.<br />

Traveler's Lodge<br />
     The lodge is famous for its hospitality and friendly service. The<br />
lodge also has its own cafe, where they make great tasting coffee. There is<br />
also a lounge for the guests to rest and relax or do some reading. The<br />
entrance is quite large and open; you get a feeling you will enjoy your<br />
stay here already.<br />

Cutting Across the Balifor Steppes<br />
    With the hustle and bustle of Balifor to your west, you find yourself<br />
at the edge of the desert plains. The road beneath your feet is nothing<br />
more than packed dirt, created over the years by the thousands of<br />
travellers that have walked this path before you. Sparse vegetation and a<br />
lack of trees make your journey a rather mundane one. A faint breeze<br />
rustles the high grass around the road and ruffles your hair.<br />

The Road To Port Balifor<br />
    This long and dusty road leads south to the port of Balifor, a busy<br />
trading centre for Krynn. All travellers are welcome in Port Balifor but<br />
one must remain wary of the constant flow of smugglers and thieves that<br />
call this town home. Known for its bawdy taverns, black markets and<br />
expansive slums, Balifor is not home for the meek.<br />

Road to Port Balifor<br />
    Dry, yellow, parched grasses expand all around you. Hot winds goad the<br />
few trees that brave the heat of the relentless summer suns, and several<br />
travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the<br />
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south. The saline smell of the sea is<br />
slight in the air, hardly noticeable, though it is obvious that the<br />
glittering, placid waters of the Khurman Sea are not far off. Curving north<br />
and west, the dusty road continues along the rolling plains.<br />
