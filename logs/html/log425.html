		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

450H 111V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS&gt; sA Muddy Street Through Zeeriak<br />
    You walk along the path leading out of Zeeriak to the south.  Ahead looms<br />
the forboding wildland of the tundra.  Legend has it that far to the south,<br />
an ominous fortress stands upon a sheer cliff of ice.  Only the very brave,<br />
or very stupid are said to seek it out, however.  Looking to the south,<br />
the snow banks seem to end only when they meet the sky.<br />

<br />
450H 110V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS&gt; sOn a Light Path<br />
    Leaving what little safety Zeeriak offers behind, you trek south<br />
towards the seemingly neverending snowbanks of the tundra far to the south.<br />
You can barely make out a small, thin trail of smoke to the south through<br />
the snow around you.<br />

    A cold wind blows across you from the far south hinting ever more at<br />
the chilling tundra that awaits you in that direction. You continue to<br />
glimpse a small trail of smoke to the south a ways off the path. You pull<br />
your cloak tighter around your neck, trying to push some of the cold away<br />
from you.<br />

450H 104V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS&gt; sMoving Closer to the Tundra<br />
    Despite all the efforts of nature to ward you from this place, you<br />
continue to make your way south towards the icy tundra. The cold wind<br />
chills you to your bones and you bring your cloak up higher to try and<br />
shake off some of the bite. You can now see a light frost blanketing the<br />
plains ahead of you, and the cold has begun to sink into your boots,<br />
numbing your toes slightly.<br />

<br />
450H 102V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS&gt; sA Frost Covered Trail<br />
    Most of what was left of the trail you were following has been covered<br />
over by the frost that settles over the entire area. You can see small<br />
footprints dotting the snow. The cold wind turns your cheeks red and you<br />
find yourself constantly rubbing your hands together to try and get feeling<br />
back into them. Just a little ways to the south, you can see and smell the<br />
welcoming scent of a cook fire wafting into the crisp air. You're not sure<br />
what could be out here cooking, but the numbness of your feet says who<br />
cares.<br />
An arrow pointing south floats nearby...it glows blue..it glows dimly<br />
<br />
450H 100V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS&gt; sOutside a Small Thatched Hut<br />
    Some of the cold has abided some, leaving you with a warm feeling<br />
coming from a small hut to the east. The thatched roof of the hut has a<br />
large chimney made of hardened mud protruding from it, and wifts of smoke<br />
trail from it. The warm glow of a fire can be seen looking in the tiny door<br />
to the hut and you feel almost compelled to go in and warm yourself.<br />
An arrow pointing south floats nearby...it glows blue..it glows dimly<br />
<br />
450H 98V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NES&gt; sTowards the Tundra<br />
    You move ever closer to the white, icy plains of the tundra. The cold<br />
here has become much harsher, and the winds blow much harder and colder.<br />
You squint your eyes and look south, but the wind blurs your vision and all<br />
you can make out is white. A small hut to the north offers you some warmth<br />
and safety from the cold winds and hungry animals.<br />

<br />
450H 94V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS&gt; sOn the Outskirts of the Tundra<br />
    Leaving the long trail from Tarsis behind you, you now stand on the<br />
edge of the mighty white tundra. The snow blows hard across the plains and<br />
the wind howls as it dances through the air. You huddle a little farther<br />
back into your cloak to try and remain a little warmer. Your cheeks have<br />
turned a bright red, and your hands have become a little stiff. To the<br />
north, you can no longer see Tarsis, but you know it is there somewhere.<br />
You can still make out thin smoke trailing from the hut you left behind. To<br />
the south, however, all you see is the white snow and awaiting cold.<br />
An arrow pointing south floats nearby...it glows blue..it glows dimly<br />
The corpse of a savage wolverine is lying here.<br />
<br />
450H 92V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS&gt; sOn the Tundra<br />
    The cold arctic wind blows heavy across the frozen tundra, and you feel<br />
numbness creeping into your bones. All around you the snow blows and whisks<br />
by in small eddies and whirlwinds as it makes its way across the white<br />
plains. The snow beneath your feet is very thick and slows your movements<br />
as you try to keep awake in the cold and monotany of walking for hours<br />
without any change of scenery. You begin to wonder if you'll ever see an<br />
end to the white tundra.<br />
