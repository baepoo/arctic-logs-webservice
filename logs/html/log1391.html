		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Northern Road<br />

gates, and south, towards the fountain and city square. A smaller road<br />

North Gate<br />
    The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to<br />
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this area<br />
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and common<br />
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands as<br />
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been torn<br />
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.<br />

Lost Knowledge<br />
    Once, great scholars came to this library to scour over tomes<br />
containing knowledge of the arcane arts, history, science, mathematics and<br />
countless other subjects. Now all of that is lost. Whatever was not<br />
crushed, burned or otherwise destroyed has long since turned to dust. The<br />
countless shelves that were once lined with books are nowhere to be seen<br />

park has been replaced with a giant crater.<br />

Wall Road<br />
    Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of<br />
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the<br />
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city, bringing<br />
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east is<br />
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road<br />
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.<br />

East Gate<br />
    All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and<br />
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have<br />
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These gates<br />
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has broken it<br />
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends in a<br />
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once<br />
stood tall.<br />
