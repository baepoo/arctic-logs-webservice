		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Solamnus Way and Southern Perimeter Road<br />
    The two roads of Solamnus and Southern Perimeter intersect here at the<br />
base of the town's large wall. The southwestern section of Vingaard appears<br />
to be residential, with mostly lower class families and individuals<br />
inhabiting the houses that appear along Southern Perimeter. The houses on<br />
Solamnus appear to be kept up a little better, and may belong to some<br />
middle-class families. A few street lamps are visible along Solamnus Way to<br />
the north, but none can be seen on Southern Perimeter as it makes its way<br />
to the east and west.<br />

Southern Perimeter Road<br />
    Home to some of Vingaard's poorer residents, the structures in this<br />
area reflect the poverty of their inhabitants. Few of the buildings have<br />
been kept up very well; most appear quite old and weathered. Pieces of<br />
trash float around in the streets, congregating mostly in the gutters with<br />
other waste. Peering down the street to the east, you notice that the<br />
edifices begin to show better upkeep and generally look nicer. To the<br />
south, Vingaard's city wall rises above you, extending far to the east and<br />
west.<br />

Solamnus Way and Southern Perimeter Road<br />
    The two roads of Solamnus and Southern Perimeter intersect here at the<br />
base of the town's large wall. The southwestern section of Vingaard appears<br />
to be residential, with mostly lower class families and individuals<br />
inhabiting the houses that appear along Southern Perimeter. The houses on<br />
Solamnus appear to be kept up a little better, and may belong to some<br />
middle-class families. A few street lamps are visible along Solamnus Way to<br />
the north, but none can be seen on Southern Perimeter as it makes its way<br />
to the east and west.<br />
