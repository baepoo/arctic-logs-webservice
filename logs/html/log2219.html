		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel<br />
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the<br />
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the<br />
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that<br />
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.<br />

    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from<br />
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A<br />
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main<br />
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for<br />
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large<br />
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the<br />
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's<br />
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.<br />
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,<br />
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.<br />
A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.<br />

    Vingaard's immense iron gates stand directly to the north, where they<br />
present a significant obstacle to any attacking force, but currently they<br />
have been raised high to allow passage of people and horses. High stone<br />
walls run east and west from here, extending quite a ways before turning<br />
beyond your vision. A road heads south where it quickly turns and heads<br />
west, passing the toll station as it travels through fields of grain, and a<br />
cobblestone avenue heads north through the gates.<br />

Inside the Gates<br />
    This large tunnel, just behind the keep's gates, travels through the<br />
thick stone walls. The ceiling above you is curved and supported by several<br />
small arches, and two great arches stand on either end of this tunnel where<br />
they lead out into openness. The road's pavement is made of smooth, gray<br />
cobblestones about the size of your fist. Torches mounted on iron brackets<br />
provide almost all of the light for the tunnel. The air seems relatively<br />
stagnant throughout the tunnel, and mixes only with the fresh outside air<br />
at the ends. The cobblestone road heads north into the town of Vingaard,<br />
and south into the surrounding lands of grain.<br />

    The cobblestone lanes of Southern Avenue and Southern Perimeter Road<br />
intersect here. A tall stone wall runs the length of the southern side of<br />
the street, and various houses have been constructed along the northern<br />
side. A faint smell of smoke mixed with various other aromas can be sensed<br />
in the air, apparently coming from the chimneys of the nearby houses. Far<br />
to the north, at the end of Southern Avenue, the tall gates to Vingaard's<br />
central park are visible. A large archway in the wall leads south to the<br />

Southern Avenue<br />
    This section of Southern Avenue passes through a well-kept and<br />
beautiful part of town. The houses on the eastern and western sides of the<br />
road are mostly stone and have large windows made of glass. The<br />
cobblestones beneath your feet, about the size of your fist, are smooth and<br />
worn. Despite this, they still fit snuggly together and feel stable as they<br />
are traversed. The road heads north where Vingaard's central park is<br />

    The cobblestone lanes of Southern Avenue and The Avenue of the<br />
Triumvirate intersect here. The edifices along the northern side of the<br />
Avenue of the Triumvirate are larger and grander than the buildings along<br />
the southern side, apparently because they serve a greater function than<br />
the houses that populate the street on the south side. The famed Temple of<br />
