		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by<br />
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their<br />
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing<br />
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot<br />
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the<br />
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge<br />
vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some sorts.<br />
A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the<br />
thick limbs which house the guild hall.<br />
A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.<br />
A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly<br />
