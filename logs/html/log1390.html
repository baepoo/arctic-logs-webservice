		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Old Tarsis Square<br />
    Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis<br />
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken shell<br />
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are shattered<br />
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced<br />
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the city.<br />

laughing and other familiar city sounds filled the air. Now there is an<br />

north-south, joining the cities fountain with the it's northern gate, while<br />
a narrow street leads east, towards the remains of an important looking<br />

Pierre's Fine Tarsis Ham<br />
    Somehow, this restaurant has survived the devastation, destruction and<br />
decay of time and remains as immaculate as the day it was last seen on<br />
Krynn. The fragrant scent of ham still lingers in the air, making your<br />
mouth water and your stomach growl. Some divine power has protected this<br />
place, and for reasons unknown to you, this place feels very important.<br />

down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends in a<br />
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once<br />

outer city wall has fallen inward, blocking the path to the north. A small<br />
road leads west, into the marketplace, and the cities east gate is just a<br />

ruin, then withstanding the gradual decay of time has left this road in a<br />

Wall Road<br />
    Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of<br />
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the<br />
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city, bringing<br />
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east is<br />
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road<br />
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.<br />

North Gate<br />
    The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to<br />
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this area<br />
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and common<br />
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands as<br />
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been torn<br />
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.<br />

countless other subjects. Now all of that is lost. Whatever was not<br />
crushed, burned or otherwise destroyed has long since turned to dust. The<br />
countless shelves that were once lined with books are nowhere to be seen<br />

Lost Knowledge<br />
    Once, great scholars came to this library to scour over tomes<br />
containing knowledge of the arcane arts, history, science, mathematics and<br />
countless other subjects. Now all of that is lost. Whatever was not<br />
crushed, burned or otherwise destroyed has long since turned to dust. The<br />
countless shelves that were once lined with books are nowhere to be seen<br />
amidst the rubble.<br />

would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this area<br />
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and common<br />
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands as<br />

was once known for the vagrants and criminals that occupied the area. Now<br />
it, like the rest of the city, is barren and desolate. A road branches off<br />

gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />

The Tarsis Dump<br />
    A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful<br />
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the wind is<br />
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been<br />
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn cart<br />
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing stirs.<br />
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of what<br />
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of their<br />
once peaceful lives covered with filth.<br />

and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced<br />
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the city.<br />

once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has broken it<br />

Before the Library<br />
    Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to<br />
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the Great<br />
Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging from<br />
its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone<br />
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of time<br />
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from invaders is<br />
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.<br />

    Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of<br />
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the<br />
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city, bringing<br />
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east is<br />
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road<br />
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.<br />

    All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and<br />
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have<br />
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These gates<br />
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has broken it<br />
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends in a<br />

indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this area<br />
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense<br />
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are hollowed<br />
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs have<br />

Old Tarsis Square<br />
    Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis<br />
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken shell<br />
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are shattered<br />
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced<br />
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the city.<br />

The Tarsis Dump<br />
    A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful<br />
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the wind is<br />
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been<br />
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn cart<br />
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing stirs.<br />
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of what<br />
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of their<br />
once peaceful lives covered with filth.<br />

    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted<br />
solid.<br />

    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted<br />
solid.<br />

Forgotten Stables<br />
    The eastern half of this huge building has collapsed onto itself,<br />
leaving half of the stables buried and unusable. Most of the horse stalls<br />
have been destroyed or fallen to ruin. This chamber has not seen a horse<br />

Old Tarsis Square<br />

fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken shell<br />

and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced<br />
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the city.<br />

collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with rubble.<br />

its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone<br />
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of time<br />

little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.<br />

East Gate<br />
    All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and<br />
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have<br />
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These gates<br />
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has broken it<br />
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends in a<br />
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once<br />

A Shattered Gate<br />
    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted<br />
solid.<br />

The Tarsis Dump<br />
    A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful<br />
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the wind is<br />
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been<br />
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn cart<br />
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing stirs.<br />
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of what<br />
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of their<br />
once peaceful lives covered with filth.<br />

of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are shattered<br />
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced<br />
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the city.<br />

A Shattered Gate<br />
    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted<br />

The Tarsis Dump<br />
    A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful<br />
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the wind is<br />
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been<br />
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn cart<br />
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing stirs.<br />
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of what<br />
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of their<br />
once peaceful lives covered with filth.<br />

    Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an<br />
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this area<br />
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense<br />
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are hollowed<br />
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs have<br />
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with rubble.<br />

    Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of<br />
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the<br />
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city, bringing<br />
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east is<br />
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road<br />
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.<br />

would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this area<br />
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and common<br />

an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been torn<br />

    A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful<br />
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the wind is<br />
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been<br />
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn cart<br />
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing stirs.<br />
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of what<br />
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of their<br />
once peaceful lives covered with filth.<br />

an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been torn<br />
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.<br />

A Path Through the Park<br />
    This dry, dusty pathy leads north-south through the old Tarsis park.<br />
This park was once full of life, a lush, vibrant forest rich with color and<br />
sound, but now it is a desolate, lonely place. The entire west half of the<br />
park has been replaced with a giant crater.<br />

Western Road<br />
    This road runs east-west, from the Tarsis fountain towards the<br />

and towards the park. Immediately to the south is a row of broken<br />
buildings, most of them empty shells or heaps of rubble.<br />

    The broken road continues westward, towards the Tarsis Wastelands which<br />
was once known for the vagrants and criminals that occupied the area. Now<br />
it, like the rest of the city, is barren and desolate. A road branches off<br />
to the south, leading towards the cities inn, while the main road leads<br />
eastward, towards the city square.<br />

A Shattered Gate<br />
    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted<br />
solid.<br />

A Shattered Gate<br />
    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted<br />
solid.<br />

A Shattered Gate<br />
    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted<br />
solid.<br />

once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has broken it<br />
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends in a<br />

left, save the restaurant to the east that has somehow, miraculously<br />

once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has broken it<br />
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends in a<br />

The Tarsis Dump<br />
    A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful<br />
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the wind is<br />
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been<br />
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn cart<br />
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing stirs.<br />
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of what<br />
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of their<br />
once peaceful lives covered with filth.<br />

The Tarsis Wastelands<br />
    Once, these Wastelands served as a walking ground for muggers,<br />
prostitutes, thieves and the like, but now it is dead and barren. The<br />
remains of a large ship that was grounded here can be seen to the south,<br />
but it had collapsed onto itself a long time ago, destroying whatever might<br />

A Shattered Gate<br />
    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted<br />
solid.<br />

gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the wind is<br />

discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn cart<br />
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing stirs.<br />
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of what<br />
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of their<br />
once peaceful lives covered with filth.<br />

The Tarsis Dump<br />
    A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful<br />
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the wind is<br />
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been<br />
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn cart<br />
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing stirs.<br />
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of what<br />
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of their<br />
once peaceful lives covered with filth.<br />
