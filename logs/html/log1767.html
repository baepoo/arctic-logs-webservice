		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

The Bottom of a Narrow Chute<br />
    This part of the passageway is slightly wider than in other places. As<br />
you look up, you notice a dark chute rising off into the distance. The wall<br />
has many scuffs marks on it where people seem to have sailed out of the<br />
chute, but not landing quite right. Small patches of moss grow in different<br />
areas here, providing some sort of florescent illumination. A fair amount<br />
of trash is piled up in the area, reminding you of the streets of some less<br />
pleasant towns of Ansalon. It seems that rats would be abundant here, but<br />
none are present, making you wonder if someone or something has run them<br />
off.<br />
