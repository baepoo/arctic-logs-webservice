		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

The Executioners Block<br />
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out<br />
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform<br />
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for<br />
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up<br />
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden<br />
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor<br />
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the<br />
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of<br />
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.<br />
Chantar the Male Theiwar Dwarf is standing here. (flying)<br />
