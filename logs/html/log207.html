		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it<br />
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits<br />
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the<br />
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and<br />
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the<br />
west is a meeting room.<br />
The Tavern owner, William Sweetwater, offers you a drink and a pie.<br />

Kanxi makes a strange sound but is <br />
suddenly very silent, as you place a razorsharp poniard in his <br />
back.<br />

Kanxi is dead! R.I.P.
