		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Slightly complex background to this log. Erand and I were running around town after people, Quv and Grifin were doing the same - probably after us. We were about to leave town when I lost link at the gates. Reconnected to find Quv and Grifin following me (Erand's diplomacy at work) so we quickly hatched a plan to beat them down without flags. Worked flawlessly, with the exception of not having any containers so Arshes got away with most of the loot. I lost link again right after this, Erand saved my laggy ass and we managed to rent easy.</i>
