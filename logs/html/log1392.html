		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

North Gate<br />
    The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to<br />
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this area<br />
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and common<br />
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands as<br />
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been torn<br />
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.<br />

Northern Road<br />
    The stone tiles of this road have long since lost their form and<br />
structure: the road here is uneven and cracked, even missing in some parts.<br />
Broken stone and gravel speckle the road, causing each footfall to create<br />
an eery &quot;crunching&quot; sound. The main road runs north, towards the city<br />
gates, and south, towards the fountain and city square. A smaller road<br />
leads eastward towards the market.<br />

Old Tarsis Square<br />
    Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis<br />
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken shell<br />
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are shattered<br />
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced<br />
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the city.<br />
