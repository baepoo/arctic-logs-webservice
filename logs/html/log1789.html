		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

A Very Strange Room<br />
    The first thing you notice about this room is that there is a large<br />
gaping hole in the floor! Centered in the room and occupying most of it is<br />
a nearly perfectly round shaft. Aside from the three-foot border along the<br />
edge, the deep, dark shaft is all that is here. Iron sconces are affixed on<br />
either side of the wall, empty, shedding no light on anything. A draft<br />
blows up from the bottom of the shaft, flowing into the room.<br />

Lord's Hall<br />
    Long ago, before the Rose Rebellion, this impressive room was known as<br />
the Throne Room. Following the founding of the Solamnic Knighthood, the<br />
room came to serve a different purpose, and has since been known as Lord's<br />
Hall. On the west side, stone arches surround beautiful casement windows.<br />
Large mirrors hang from the eastern wall opposite the windows, light<br />
glittering off their silvered surface and gold leafed frames. A few torches<br />
on the wall cast light that shimmers and dances about as it burns. High<br />
above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the shining<br />
colors and images of the knighthood faded and dull. On the south end, the<br />
red-carpeted floor takes a few steps up. Rather than a single throne, four<br />
elegantly carved chairs rest here behind a bench.<br />

covered with a red carpet that probably once was quite beautiful, but is<br />
now faded and worn as well.<br />

Lord's Hall<br />
    Long ago, before the Rose Rebellion, this impressive room was known as<br />
the Throne Room. Following the founding of the Solamnic Knighthood, the<br />
room came to serve a different purpose, and has since been known as Lord's<br />
Hall. On the west side, stone arches surround beautiful casement windows.<br />
Large mirrors hang from the eastern wall opposite the windows, light<br />
glittering off their silvered surface and gold leafed frames. A few torches<br />
on the wall cast light that shimmers and dances about as it burns. High<br />
above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the shining<br />
colors and images of the knighthood faded and dull. On the south end, the<br />
red-carpeted floor takes a few steps up. Rather than a single throne, four<br />
elegantly carved chairs rest here behind a bench.<br />

Lord's Hall<br />
    Long ago, before the Rose Rebellion, this impressive room was known as<br />
the Throne Room. Following the founding of the Solamnic Knighthood, the<br />
room came to serve a different purpose, and has since been known as Lord's<br />
Hall. On the west side, stone arches surround beautiful casement windows.<br />
Large mirrors hang from the eastern wall opposite the windows, light<br />
glittering off their silvered surface and gold leafed frames. A few torches<br />
on the wall cast light that shimmers and dances about as it burns. High<br />
above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the shining<br />
colors and images of the knighthood faded and dull. On the south end, the<br />
red-carpeted floor takes a few steps up. Rather than a single throne, four<br />
elegantly carved chairs rest here behind a bench.<br />

High above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the<br />

Lord's Hall<br />
    Long ago, before the Rose Rebellion, this impressive room was known as<br />
the Throne Room. Following the founding of the Solamnic Knighthood, the<br />
room came to serve a different purpose, and has since been known as Lord's<br />
Hall. On the west side, stone arches surround beautiful casement windows.<br />
Large mirrors hang from the eastern wall opposite the windows, light<br />
glittering off their silvered surface and gold leafed frames. A few torches<br />
on the wall cast light that shimmers and dances about as it burns. High<br />
above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the shining<br />
colors and images of the knighthood faded and dull. On the south end, the<br />
red-carpeted floor takes a few steps up. Rather than a single throne, four<br />
elegantly carved chairs rest here behind a bench.<br />

Lord's Hall<br />
    Long ago, before the Rose Rebellion, this impressive room was known as<br />
the Throne Room. Following the founding of the Solamnic Knighthood, the<br />
room came to serve a different purpose, and has since been known as Lord's<br />
Hall. On the west side, stone arches surround beautiful casement windows.<br />
Large mirrors hang from the eastern wall opposite the windows, light<br />
glittering off their silvered surface and gold leafed frames. A few torches<br />
on the wall cast light that shimmers and dances about as it burns. High<br />
above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the shining<br />
colors and images of the knighthood faded and dull. On the south end, the<br />
red-carpeted floor takes a few steps up. Rather than a single throne, four<br />
elegantly carved chairs rest here behind a bench.<br />

away. Stone walls border you to the south and east, rising high up to the<br />

to be the base of a tower pushes out from the wall into the hallway, its<br />
curved side narrowing the point of passage and providing an excellent<br />
internal defense point. An open doorway leads east to the turret.<br />
