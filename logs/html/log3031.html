		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

A Dark Corridor<br />
     The hallway bends here, heading east and far to the south. The walls<br />
and ceiling are made of the same dark gray stones that are characteristic<br />
of the citadel. An uncomfortable silence hangs heavily in the air, mixed<br />
with a sense of a prevalent evil. The air is warm, but seems stale and<br />
dusty. Very few candles are used to light the room, and as a result, the<br />
light is very dim.<br />
&lt;WILD&gt; Cate the Tenderling is standing here. (flying) (invisible)<br />

A Dark Corridor<br />
     The dark hallway extends to the north and south from here. The ceiling<br />
of dark stones is about eight feet high, and is supported by arches<br />
approximately every fifteen feet. The dim lighting provided by the candles<br />
on the wall is sufficient only for seeing objects up close. At a distance,<br />
there is little more than the presence of darkness to mark where someone or<br />
something is. Faint screams seem to occasionally echo through the corridor,<br />
piercing the eerie silence.<br />

A Dark Corridor<br />
     The few candles set on sconces light this corridor dimly. The hallway<br />
is very quiet, and the only sounds seem to be those of nearby boots<br />
clicking on the dark stones that make up the floor. Breathing is much<br />
easier here than outside as the air is warm and thick, but slightly stale.<br />
The hallway continues north, while it intersects another hallway to the<br />
east.<br />
A greenish-purple mist hangs in the air.<br />

A Dark Corridor<br />

approximately every fifteen feet. The dim lighting provided by the candles<br />

A Shrine to the Dark Queen<br />
    A small room just off the side of the foyer, this shrine is dedicated<br />
to the Dark Queen, Takhisis. Lighting is minimal, what little there is<br />
shines onto the lower half of a large statue of a five-headed dragon,<br />
located at the center of the room. The shadows cast across the dragon's<br />
features produce a most terrifying effect, almost bringing the malevolent<br />
form to life. A strange smell hangs in the air, reminiscent of decaying<br />
flesh. Dark, powerful energy almost seems to flow from the statue, the hand<br />
of Takhisis reaching out.<br />

black iron cross the wooden beams horizontally, and are fastened to the<br />
door with large bolts. The stones around the door are all weathered and<br />

     The dark hallway extends to the north and south from here. The ceiling<br />
of dark stones is about eight feet high, and is supported by arches<br />

something is. Faint screams seem to occasionally echo through the corridor,<br />

Northwestern Corner of the Courtyard<br />
     The citadel's main complex lies to the west while the newer looking of<br />
the two towers rises to the north. The dark stones of the main complex look<br />
much older than those on the north tower, and lack the slight shimmering<br />
quality. The air is very cold and thin from the high altitude, making<br />
breathing tough, and a great feeling of evil hangs in the silence. There<br />
are no signs of plants or animals as little could live in this inhospitable<br />
environment.<br />

Southwestern Corner of the Courtyard<br />
     The main complex of the citadel lies to the west, along with a large<br />
wooden door to the lower level. The main complex looks to be made of the<br />
same dark stone and mortar as the walls of the tower to the south. The<br />
mortar has turned to a gelatinous liquid, and slowly oozes out from between<br />
the stones. A great sense of evil permeates through the cold, silent air.<br />

South Side of the Courtyard<br />
     The citadel's southern tower stands directly to the south. The stones<br />
it is constructed of are dark and weathered. The gray mortar holding the<br />
stones together has almost turned to a liquid, and slowly oozes out from<br />
between the stones, occasionally splattering on the ground. Still, it does<br />
not seem that any mass is lost, as the tower maintains its strength. A few<br />

dripped mortar.<br />

Southeastern Corner of the Courtyard<br />
     A dark stone wall runs north and south along the eastern side of the<br />
courtyard, preventing eastward movement. The wall heads south, then turns<br />
west and passes behind the citadel's southern tower. The mortar holding the<br />
stones together has a liquid quality, and slowly drips down the wall's<br />
side. A small passage runs south along the base of the wall. The air is<br />
very thin from the high altitude, causing you to become short of breath<br />
very quickly.<br />

East Side of the Courtyard<br />
     A large stone wall encloses the east side of the courtyard. The wall<br />
is at least twenty feet high, and is made of the same dark stones as the<br />
courtyard beneath your feet. However, the mortar that holds the stones<br />
together in the walls has turned to a liquid, and slowly oozes out and<br />
splatters onto the ground. Somehow, the walls maintain their strength, yet<br />
no substance seems to be lost. Two large towers rise on the north and south<br />
sides of the courtyard. A small staircase has been built into the wall to<br />
the east, leading up.<br />

Center of the Courtyard<br />
     The great citadel of Galan Dracos surrounds the courtyard on all sides<br />
but the east, its two large towers rising into the sky. The ground beneath<br />
your feet is made of very dark, almost black cobblestones. Most of the<br />
citadel including the southern tower looks old and weathered, but the<br />
northern tower looks much newer. The air is cold and fresh, and it is very<br />
quiet as few creatures dare venture near this horrid place.<br />

     An immense staircase ascends to the west, and is made of the same dark<br />
stones as the courtyard below your feet. The staircase leads up to a large<br />
door on the second floor of the main complex. The main complex has the same<br />
dull black appearance as the southern tower that rises to the south where<br />
the courtyard ends, but looks different from the northern tower. The dark<br />
courtyard extends north, east, and south.<br />

the entrance of the second floor on the west. A thick banister of smooth<br />
black granite lines the sides of the stairs on each side, going from the<br />
courtyard to the second floor entrance. At the base of each of the<br />
banisters stands a giant black statue of a wicked dragon. Unlike the<br />

located at the center of the room. The shadows cast across the dragon's<br />
features produce a most terrifying effect, almost bringing the malevolent<br />
form to life. A strange smell hangs in the air, reminiscent of decaying<br />
flesh. Dark, powerful energy almost seems to flow from the statue, the hand<br />
of Takhisis reaching out.<br />

Mages' Laboratory<br />
     This large rectangular room is built with its length heading east-west<br />
and its door on the western side of the northern wall. Globes of continuous<br />
light hang in the corners and along the tops of the walls, casting pale<br />
white light throughout the room. This laboratory appears to have been set<br />
up to aid the mages in their spell development. Shelves containing books<br />
and large glass jars cover most of the room's walls, and several large<br />
stone tables rest in the center of the room. Several small objects around<br />
the room continuously fade in and out of sight, apparently failures of a<br />

the candles that provide light.<br />

A Long Stone Hallway<br />
     This hallway passes north-south through the southern portion of the<br />
citadel's main complex. The walls and ceiling are made of large, flat, dark<br />
stones. The ceiling here is much lower here than the vaulted ceilings in<br />
the foyer to the south. Candles mounted regularly along the walls, as well<br />
on tall candelabras that rest on the floor, provide the dim light in the<br />
hallway. The hallway is very quiet except for the sounds of boots on the<br />
stone floor.<br />

The Foyer<br />
     This large room serves as the entryway to the citadel's second floor.<br />
The vaulted ceiling high above you is nearly invisible in the dark shadows.<br />
Sconces are attached to all four sides of the many pillars that rise into<br />
the air to support the ceiling and provide light that is adequate, but<br />
still relatively dim. The walls have no windows or openings for air to come<br />
in, resulting in the air being warm and stale. Two large doors to the east<br />
open out into the courtyard, while hallways lead to the north and south.<br />

Climbing a Huge Flight of Stairs<br />
     The immense staircase of smooth, dark stone ascends from the east to<br />
the entrance of the second floor on the west. A thick banister of smooth<br />
black granite lines the sides of the stairs on each side, going from the<br />
courtyard to the second floor entrance. At the base of each of the<br />
banisters stands a giant black statue of a wicked dragon. Unlike the<br />

     An immense staircase ascends to the west, and is made of the same dark<br />
stones as the courtyard below your feet. The staircase leads up to a large<br />
door on the second floor of the main complex. The main complex has the same<br />
dull black appearance as the southern tower that rises to the south where<br />

Northwestern Corner of the Courtyard<br />
     The citadel's main complex lies to the west while the newer looking of<br />
the two towers rises to the north. The dark stones of the main complex look<br />
much older than those on the north tower, and lack the slight shimmering<br />
quality. The air is very cold and thin from the high altitude, making<br />
breathing tough, and a great feeling of evil hangs in the silence. There<br />
are no signs of plants or animals as little could live in this inhospitable<br />
environment.<br />

Before the Iron-banded Doors<br />
     This small passageway between the north tower and the staircase<br />
leading to the second floor ends at two large doors. The doors set into the<br />
western wall are made of thick wooden beams set vertically. Large bands of<br />
black iron cross the wooden beams horizontally, and are fastened to the<br />
door with large bolts. The stones around the door are all weathered and<br />
gray, much like the ones in the wall to the south, but the viscous mortar<br />
between them does not seem to drip down over the doorway.<br />

A Dark Corridor<br />
     The dark hallway extends to the north and south from here. The ceiling<br />
of dark stones is about eight feet high, and is supported by arches<br />
approximately every fifteen feet. The dim lighting provided by the candles<br />
on the wall is sufficient only for seeing objects up close. At a distance,<br />
there is little more than the presence of darkness to mark where someone or<br />
something is. Faint screams seem to occasionally echo through the corridor,<br />
piercing the eerie silence.<br />

A Shrine to the Dark Queen<br />
    A small room just off the side of the foyer, this shrine is dedicated<br />
to the Dark Queen, Takhisis. Lighting is minimal, what little there is<br />
shines onto the lower half of a large statue of a five-headed dragon,<br />
located at the center of the room. The shadows cast across the dragon's<br />
features produce a most terrifying effect, almost bringing the malevolent<br />
form to life. A strange smell hangs in the air, reminiscent of decaying<br />
flesh. Dark, powerful energy almost seems to flow from the statue, the hand<br />
of Takhisis reaching out.<br />
