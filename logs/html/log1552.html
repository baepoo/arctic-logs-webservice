		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    The room is quite cozy, arranged with a few large tables and<br />
comfortable chairs around them. It also seems very quiet in here, perhaps a<br />
magical spell was laid on the room so that those who used it could study<br />
their craft without distraction. The walls are nearly covered with<br />
bookcases that are filled with many types of books that magi would find<br />
useful. A soft white light emanates from the ceiling, but you do not see<br />
the source.<br />

63H 131V 7513768X 10740C Mem:10 Exits:ES&gt; eThe Herbalist's Shop<br />
    An overpowering smell greets those that enter this small shop. The<br />
smell appears to come from the racks and racks of herbs throughout the<br />
shop. The herbs grow in all shapes, sizes, and colors, ranging from<br />
sphagnum moss to dragon herb (similar to wolfbane, only different.)<br />
Skylights in the roof above you allow light to pass to the plants during<br />
the daytime, warming the moist, stagnant air. In the back corner of the<br />
shop sits a black pot on a stove and a foul smell emanating from it.<br />
<br />
63H 130V 7513768X 10740C Mem:10 Exits:NW&gt; nThe Avenue of the Triumvirate<br />
    Many houses of Vingaard's middle-class families stand on the north and<br />
south sides of this road as it passes east-west through the southwestern<br />
section of Vingaard. Most of the houses are made of stone, and are one to<br />
two stories tall. Short stone paths lead to the wooden front doors of the<br />
houses, with a few plants along its sides. Entrance to nearly all of the<br />
houses is prevented by gates that have been locked and barred, except to<br />
the south where the gate stands open. An array of small plants grows in the<br />
garden to the south, and the house appears to belong to a herbalist.<br />

    The cobblestone lanes of Southern Avenue and The Avenue of the<br />
Triumvirate intersect here. The edifices along the northern side of the<br />
Avenue of the Triumvirate are larger and grander than the buildings along<br />
the southern side, apparently because they serve a greater function than<br />
the houses that populate the street on the south side. The famed Temple of<br />
Paladine stands to the northeast, and another large stone building stands<br />
to the northwest. The central park is visible a bit to the north.<br />
A cityguard marches down the street, keeping a vigilant eye for danger.<br />
A street sweeper stands here, sweeping up dirt and trash.<br />
<br />
63H 128V 7513768X 10740C Mem:10 Exits:NESW&gt; nSouthern Avenue<br />
    The cobblestone avenue heads north and south here, where it extends for<br />
quite a distance. The gates to the central park of Vingaard rise high into<br />
the sky just to the north, while the famed Temple of Paladine stands to the<br />
east. Cobblestones beneath your feet are round and worn from the nearly<br />
constant usage. Amazingly, they still fit tight and snug after centuries.<br />
The city stretches out far in all directions. To the south, houses of all<br />
types are visible, while large buildings are visible across the park to the<br />
north.<br />
<br />
63H 127V 7513768X 10740C Mem:10 Exits:NS&gt; nSouthern Avenue and Garrison Street<br />
    The heart of the city, Garrison Street appears to be a quite popular<br />
place to be during the daylight hours. Various stalls are spread out along<br />
the street, each with a skilled artisan selling its creations. A brick wall<br />
covered with vines and flowers sits on the northern edge of the street. To<br />
the north, green vines climb over and through the bars of the fence<br />
surrounding the park, preventing one from seeing clearly into the park,<br />
while providing a sense of privacy to those in the park.<br />
<br />
63H 126V 7513768X 10740C Mem:10 Exits:NESW&gt; eGarrison Street<br />
    Named for the establishment that once stood here at the time of the<br />
city's foundation, Garrison Street now serves as a venue for artisans to<br />
sell their crafts. The center of the city, this street seems to be a very<br />
popular place to pass the time during the daylight hours. The famed Temple<br />
of Paladine stands to the south, its large platinum doors resting solemnly,<br />
and a vine covered brick wall runs the length of the road on the north<br />
side. A light, sweet smell seems to drift towards your nose from the<br />
flowers on the vines.<br />
A wooden stall with a table sits here for artisans to display their wares on.<br />
<br />
63H 125V 7513768X 10740C Mem:10 Exits:ESW&gt; sEntrance to the Temple of Paladine<br />
    Twin staircases of white marble descend to the north and south, meeting<br />
the roads that run parallel to the ancient structure. Gates of crafted<br />
platinum stand to the east, the symbols of the great God Paladine upon<br />
them. The white marble of the columns, walls, and roofs all show signs of<br />
heavy weathering, a result of the neglect and abandonment suffered in the<br />
years after the cataclysm. Though neglected, the temple does not appear to<br />
have been vandalized. A small garden blossoms to the west, while the gates<br />
lead within the temple.<br />
A pigeon walks about pecking the ground and running from your feet.<br />
<br />
63H 124V 7513768X 10740C Mem:10 Exits:NES&gt; eThe Temple of Paladine<br />
    Aged white marble rises up around and over your head as you pass<br />
through this small archway between the main temple and its gates. The<br />
arches are spaced approximately ten feet apart, square, and they ascend the<br />
walls then crisscross above. Words have been carved into the walls, however<br />
they are of a unknown language, their meaning lost to time. Torches placed<br />
upon the arches provide lighting for this passage.<br />
<br />
63H 123V 7513768X 10740C Mem:5 Exits:EW&gt; eBeneath the Temple's Dome<br />
    You stand beneath the beautiful white marble dome at the center of the<br />
temple. The walls stretch high above you, and seem to bend and curl as they<br />
make their way to the dome's center. The room is circular in shape, and all<br />
of it is made from white marble. The floor is smooth and beautiful, but its<br />
age shows clearly. Torches mounted along the walls burn quietly, providing<br />
ample light for the large room. A large statue of a platinum dragon,<br />
dedicated to the god Paladine, stands in the center of the room.<br />
An adventurer, new to Vingaard, searches for an inn or a tavern.<br />
A young acolyte of Paladine is here, cleaning the temple.<br />
A street sweeper stands here, sweeping up dirt and trash.<br />
<br />
63H 122V 7513768X 10740C Mem:5 Exits:NESW&gt; eThe Head Priestess' Office<br />
    A large stone table rests in the center of this room, one of only a few<br />
objects visible. Graying parchment rests on the surface of the table,<br />
instructions and notes scrawled over them. The room is nearly empty aside<br />
from the table and a few candles that provide dim lighting. The air hangs<br />
with a strange sensation, one of sadness, but a sadness brightened by hope<br />
for the future.<br />
