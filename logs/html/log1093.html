		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    This area of the courtyard appears to be empty, although you feel eyes<br />
watching you. To the south is a huge wall, with a single archway leading<br />

    This guard station serves as a buffer between the outer courtyard and<br />
the main keep. There is a small archway in the northern wall, and the<br />
courtyard extends in all other directions. The archway serves as a choke<br />
point: all access to the main keep passes through this station. If the keep<br />
were to be attacked, the intruders would have to pass through this arch as<br />
well, making it an excellent location for an ambush.<br />

Courtyard in the Keep<br />
    Broken swords, staves and shields have been pushed against the eastern<br />
wall here. The knights are training so intensely here that breaking weapons<br />
is almost a routine. Several Knights of the Thorn are training here, ready<br />
to assist the wounded, should the need arise. The stone floor is chipped<br />
and cracked in several places, no doubt another side effect from the large<br />
volume of training that goes on in this courtyard.<br />

the courtyard, offering refreshment to the knights as they train. There are<br />

The Path of Puddles<br />
    Harsh winds and piercing rain pummels you as you make your way along<br />
this path. The path itself is more like a shallow river that leads north,<br />
towards what you assume would be the keep. Through the dense fog and the<br />
constant barrage of rain blurring your vision you can see the large gates<br />
to the keep a short distance off to your north. You hasten your steps,<br />
hoping to get out of this storm, either by forcing your way into the<br />
shelter of the keep, or by letting yourself get captured.<br />
