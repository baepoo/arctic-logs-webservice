		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

mining carts, which pass by: sometimes relaxedly and sometimes with<br />
reckless abandon. Many dwarves of the village walk on the sides of the<br />
tunnel. From the west interesting smells of smithing and other manufactured<br />
goods waft into the room. To the east and south the Main Way continues.<br />

Deep Mine Main Way<br />
    Dancing orange flames from torches mounted near the ceiling, brightly<br />
color this tunnel far below the earth. Being the principle tunnel of the<br />
village, its width and height can easily clear the consciousness of<br />
thousands of tons of rock above. Deep treads in the ground indicate the<br />
path of mining carts, which lie only in the center of the tunnel. The sides<br />
seem to have been given to regular villagers. Miners walk in groups, while<br />
a little lass with short whiskers can be seen carrying home some groceries.<br />
Dwarven children, who have not yet begun education in any of the principle<br />
areas of the town, play in the large tunnel, dodging through the mining<br />
carts. The path south leads to a junction in the Main Way, while to the<br />
north the Main Way continues.<br />

Junction Four<br />
    The Main Way branches in two directions at the Junction. To the west a<br />
smaller tunnel, too tight for mine carts to pass through, meanders through<br />
the mountain, while to the south and north the Main Way continues steadily.<br />
Orange-flamed torches hinged against the western wall light the junction<br />
and its complimentary sign. The sign consists simply of a large four. A<br />
loud explosion is heard a good way off to the west.<br />

Deep Mine Main Way<br />
    Bright torches, mounted near the ceiling, light the regularly used<br />
tunnel. Huge tread marks have permanently set themselves in the ground,<br />
indicative of the heavy mine carts regularly traveling through the<br />
underground village. Avoiding the path of the mine carts, villagers stick<br />
to the side of the tunnels. There is plenty of room for everyone in the<br />
region as the tunnel maintains its steady width of at least six minotaurs<br />
and height of four. The tunnel leads to both the north and east. In both<br />
directions lie Junctions in the tunnel system of Deep Mine.<br />

    The main tunnel of Deep Mine reaches an intersection here. A large sign<br />
on the northern wall labels the intersection with a large number five. Deep<br />
treads in the ground act as tracks for mining carts. The tracks go in all<br />
directions of the tunnel, however the path to the east seems slightly more<br />
used by mining carts. Hanging heavy lanterns, which give off a pretty<br />
orange flame, light the intersection.<br />

Path of the Miner's<br />
    Lit by torches clamped against the walls of the tunnel, the path here<br />
is not quite as wide or as tall as the Deep Mine Main Way. However, the<br />
spacing is still ample. Many mining carts wheel past, heading both towards<br />
and away from the great dwarven mining guild at the end of this tunnel.<br />
Dwarven mining apprentices in their young years gather in this area,<br />
chattering excitedly. The path leads north towards the guild and west to<br />

Outside the Dwarven Miner's Guild<br />
    The facade of the Dwarven Mining Guild is quite impressive. Intricately<br />
carved statues of dwarven miners jut out of the solid rock of which the<br />
guild is cut from. Emeralds, rubies, amethysts, and topazes are encrusted<br />
within the rock, dandifying the already flamboyant display. The tunnel<br />
expands before the guild in almost a large forum. Some miners are visiting<br />
the variety of food stalls set up outside of the guild, taking a quick<br />
break in their days work, while others lean against the building chatting<br />
over new drilling techniques. The guild stands three stories tall, as noted<br />
by the hollowed out rock holes, which serve as windows. To the east lies<br />
the entry hall of the prosperous guild, while the path to the south takes<br />
you away from it.<br />

Entry Hall of the Miner's Guild<br />
    The entry hall of the guild is much plainer than the gaudy exterior. In<br />
fact from the look of it, the interior of the guild in general has the more<br />
traditional severity associated with a group of manual labor workers.<br />
Propped against the northern wall is a small chair, perfect for dozing.<br />
Tracks for mining carts lead all the way to the eastern edge of the room,<br />
where there is a circle, allowing the carts to turn around, once unloading<br />
or loading supplies and goods. A few dwarves steadily watch the incoming<br />
and out going carts. The exit of the guild lies directly to the west, while<br />
in the eastern direction the guild continues.<br />

Ore Grade Determination Station<br />
    Heaps and heaps of rawly mined materials enter from the mining carts to<br />
the west. Here, they are examined to see if they meet the guilds high<br />
standard of materials for processing. Over twenty desks are set up as<br />
examination stations. When a piece is examined properly, the examiners seem<br />
to pleasantly place them in miniature carts on rollers, which when filled are<br />
moved south into the processing halls. However, in the rare moments when<br />
the raw materials are not up to snuff, a snarl can be seen on the examiners<br />
face as he hurls it against the northern wall. A small pile of the rubble<br />
lies here, ready to be returned to the depths of the mountain.<br />
The corpse of an inexperienced dwarven miner is lying here. [2]<br />

Processing Hall<br />
    The processing hall is split up into three major sections: metals,<br />
precious metals, and gems. This area must be the metals area. At the many<br />
processing stations dwarves labor over the extraction of mithril and steel<br />
alloys, as well as natural metals, namely copper and iron. Processed metals<br />
seem to end up against the southern wall. To the west the processing hall<br />
continues, while to the north lies the ore grade determination area.<br />
The corpse of an experienced dwarven metal processor is lying here.<br />

Processing Hall<br />
    The precious metals region of the processing hall is loaded with veins<br />
of gold and silver taken directly out of the mines. The processing of the<br />
precious metals is much more meticulously watched. Tiny hammers with<br />
blunted heads are strewn all about. Clearly, the processors of precious<br />
metals do not wish to damage their products at all. To the south lies gem<br />
processing, while to the east lies metal processing. The western wall nests<br />
a spectacular collection of precious metals.<br />
