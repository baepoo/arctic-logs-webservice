		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

An Underground Cellblock<br />
    The only item of interest here is a dark cell to the north, shadows<br />
obstruct the corners and through its rusted iron bars its hard to see much<br />
of anything. Stone walls continue toward the west, where another cell<br />
stands, and to the east where this hall ends. An eerie rhythmic sound<br />
echoes in your ears from somewhere close by though it's hard to place.<br />
A short shaft of black wood is rolling around here.<br />
<br />
282H 66V 1443595X 3C Mem:3 Exits:NEW&gt; w<br />
You hear a thumping sound coming from the south.<br />
An Underground Cellblock<br />
    Curiously the southern wall here looks like it was once a cell door,<br />
but is now sealed with stone and mortar. Directly north of it is an equally<br />
bizarre sight, a steel cell door frame is laden with magical runes and<br />
scrawlings. Two torches on opposing sides of the room keep the hall lit,<br />
and further down the hall another cell resides behind the northern wall. A<br />
bit to the west the cell block ends at an intersection.<br />
<br />
282H 64V 1443595X 3C Mem:3 Exits:(N)EW&gt; w<br />
Entering the Cellblock<br />
    The end of the cellblock is relatively nondescript, the walls are bare<br />
stone, as is the floor and ceiling. On either side of the room a bright<br />
torch is fastened to the wall, spitting glowing embers into the musty air.<br />
Strange noises shortly catch your attention to the east, while the only<br />
other direction to go is into an intersection west of here.<br />
<br />
282H 62V 1443595X 3C Mem:3 Exits:EW&gt; w<br />
A Dank Cellar<br />
    Three choices lay before you at this intersection. Towards the north<br />
you see no immediate danger and south of here the cellar appears to be<br />
empty save the little insects that live here, while to the east a row of<br />
cells lines the hallway. Decaying timbers barely support the heavy ceiling<br />
here, some of them stand only midway up the wall having collapsed under<br />
their own weight. The cellar's air is fetid with the smell of rot and<br />
decay, making you think twice before taking a deep breath.<br />
<br />
282H 60V 1443595X 3C Mem:3 Exits:NES&gt; w<br />
Alas, you cannot go that way...<br />
<br />

Looking north:<br />
The northern cellar hallway runs perpendicular to this passage.<br />
Cadiseus the Male Theiwar Dwarf is standing here.<br />
Looking east:<br />
The passage heads into a gloomy block of cells.<br />
Looking south:<br />
The cellar is more dimly lit in this direction.<br />
Looking west:<br />
A couple of fluttering torches are bracketed to the wall.<br />
Looking up:<br />
The grey stone ceiling looms a few feet overhead.<br />
Looking down:<br />
The only thing on the floor besides dust is the occasional insect.<br />
<br />
282H 60V 1443595X 3C Mem:3 Exits:NES&gt; n<br />
A Cellar Hallway<br />
    The hallway takes a turn here, crooking eastward and further south. At<br />
the far eastern corner of the cellar you can see a staircase through the<br />
gloomy torchlight, while directly west of you a solid wall of earth impedes<br />
movement. Thick oak timbers stand tall along the walls, supporting the<br />
stone ceiling, though some are becoming warped and bowed by stress. Light<br />
is plentiful here, provided by a few newly lit torches attached to the<br />
walls though the air is smokey and a bit smothering.<br />
Cadiseus the Male Theiwar Dwarf is standing here.<br />
<br />
282H 58V 1443595X 3C Mem:3 Exits:ES&gt; c 'harm'cadiseus<br />

Cadiseus leaves east.<br />

282H 58V 1443595X 3C Mem:4 Exits:ES&gt; e<br />
A Cellar Hallway<br />
    Yellow torchlight illuminates the area, provided by several torches<br />
that are bracketed to the rock walls. A passage heads west, further into<br />
the cellar, and a staircase sculpted out of the eastern wall leads up<br />
north, where it leads out of this basement floor. The air reeks of mildew<br />
and soot, and the cold stone walls chill your bones.<br />
