		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

A Dry Old Road<br />
    This large road, composed mostly of dry, dusty dirt, winds its way<br />
across the parched yellow grasses of the plains towards Delphon to the<br />
west, and to a crossroads east of here. The wind carries with it the sounds<br />
of Delphon, a large city whose towering gates glitter in both darkness and<br />
light. Many travelers pass you by, most heading west towards Delphon or<br />
beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests southeast of here, along the<br />
shores of the Khurman Sea. A small path runs to the southwest, skirting<br />

Intersection of Alan Ak-Khan<br />
    Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are<br />
usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down. This<br />
crossroads is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants<br />
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on<br />
the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port<br />
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder<br />
that bandits frequent these roads.<br />
