		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Traveling Through a Windy Tunnel<br />
     Roaring winds pummel you from the east. Pressure builds against your<br />
chest making it hard to breathe. Dirt and dust borne along by the wind have<br />
sandpapered the walls and floor of the tunnel to nearly the texture of<br />
glass. A few natural fissures in the rock surface provide the only grip.<br />
While the wind seems strongly intent on blowing you back upward, you can<br />
brave it further east down the tunnel.<br />

The Down Slope<br />
     The passage slopes down roughly twenty degrees shy of vertical. A<br />
stiff breeze whips by you from below where a low roar can be heard. It<br />
smells faintly like lantern oil. A steady grip is difficult here. Carrying<br />
bits of dirt and dust, the rushing air has slowly scoured the rough tunnel<br />
walls and floor. The skin on your face is proving to be much less<br />
resilient. The wind declines some to the west but grows even more brisk<br />

Through A Descending Passage<br />
     A passage branches off from the main cavern and slopes gently down<br />
into the bedrock. The rock walls are rough and covered with a layer of<br />
dirt. An unusually steady breeze blows in from the east and rushes past<br />
you. Further travel is possible north into another branch, east down the<br />
slope, or back west.<br />

Within a Cavernous Chamber<br />
    The monstrous cavern expands in all directions. Long stalactites hang<br />
down from the heights of the ceiling like daggers. A forest of rock columns<br />
rises up to meet them. The noisy flutter of leathery wings can be heard<br />
echoing from above. The deep shadows cloaking the cavern's upper reaches<br />
make it impossible to tell what else lurks up there. Judging by the horde<br />
of paw prints in the dirt, the cavern sees much traffic. The tracks stretch<br />
off to the north, south, east and west into a maze of tunnels.<br />

Within a Cavernous Chamber<br />
     The bedrock walls curve high above you, forcing you to strain your<br />
neck just to glimpse the ceiling. This huge cavity appears to have been<br />
hollowed out by an ancient underground river, which you hope dried up long<br />
ago. The musty air smells of blood and fresh bones are strewn about the<br />
ground. Many of them look human... Though the river may be gone, something<br />
more foul now calls these caves home.<br />

Beneath a Skeletal Archway<br />
     The tunnel ends at a gruesome archway to the north. A collection of<br />
animal and human bones has been arranged in odd patterns to form the arch.<br />
Some of the bones are bleached white, while rotting scraps of flesh still<br />
hang from others. Set as the capstone is a chipped human skull from which<br />
still hangs one eye. Passage is possible north through the archway or back<br />
south into the tunnel.<br />

A Blood Smeared Tunnel<br />
     The air is ages old and tastes stale. It hangs in your lungs like a<br />
lead weight. The stench of blood and something more foul drifts through the<br />
tunnel assaulting your nose. On the walls can be seen streaks of red in<br />
sets of five, as if someone dipped their hands in a bucket of red paint and<br />
dragged them across the rock. What appear to be paw prints run north and<br />
west through the tunnel.<br />

A Crevice Between the Rock<br />
     Barely more than a thin slit between the bedrock, even a kender would<br />
find it hard squeezing through this passage. Pressing your back against the<br />
opposite wall, you suck in your gut and manage to slowly wiggle through. A<br />
fine shower of dirt rains down tickling your nose.<br />

A Dangerously Deep Pit<br />

roughly twenty yards above you, more than high enough for most creatures to<br />

End of the Trail<br />
     The trail runs in from the north and continues several yards to the<br />
south...then abruptly stops. It's as if both hunter and hunted just<br />
vanished into the ether. The only things left are the low keen of the wind<br />
and some pinecones clacking down from above. The sounds help to drown out<br />
the other noises, the shrieks and calls of unseen things lurking in the<br />
deep shadows.<br />

End of the Trail<br />
     The trail runs in from the north and continues several yards to the<br />
south...then abruptly stops. It's as if both hunter and hunted just<br />
vanished into the ether. The only things left are the low keen of the wind<br />
and some pinecones clacking down from above. The sounds help to drown out<br />
the other noises, the shrieks and calls of unseen things lurking in the<br />
deep shadows.<br />

Along an Old Hunting Trail<br />
     The trail is very haphazard here. It goes a few yards one direction,<br />
turns sharply, then a few more yards another way. Whoever or whatever<br />
created it looks to have been in a frightful panic, and most likely lost.<br />
Halfway down the trail several gouges and depressions have been made in the<br />
loose dirt, as if something fell there before taking off again. The gouges<br />
appear to have been dug by hands...human hands. From the looks of it that<br />
person wasn't the hunter.<br />

     Pinecones and damp leaves lie tossed aside from something or someone<br />
racing headlong into the woods. The lower tree branches have been bent to<br />
make way for whatever passed through here. From the looks of it, this<br />
happened recently, no more than a day ago. Several distinct tracks, hunter<br />
and prey, are still visible in the dirt and snapped twigs. Tracing the<br />
path, the pursuit appears to have started at some ferns to the east and<br />
continued west, deep into the heart of the forest.<br />

it the heavy scent of pine. The smell is almost suffocating as it forces<br />
its way into your lungs till the bitter taste hangs in your mouth. Panic<br />
begins to set in as your eyes dart from shadow to shadow.<br />
