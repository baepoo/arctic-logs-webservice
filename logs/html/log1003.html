		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and<br />
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of<br />
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of<br />
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has<br />

Eastern Avenue<br />
    The road is cut from among the huge vallenwoods which protect and house<br />
the inhabitants of Solace. The limbs overhead entwine with one another to<br />
provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the sun,<br />
while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large<br />
vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you notice a<br />
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway spirals<br />
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the<br />
temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west towards<br />
Solace Square.<br />

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by<br />
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their<br />
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing<br />
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot<br />

north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge<br />
vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some sorts.<br />
A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the<br />
