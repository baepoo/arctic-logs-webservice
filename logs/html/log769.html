		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the remote<br />

Nearing The Top of the Mountain<br />
    The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this<br />
distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and the<br />
biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life<br />
anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that of<br />
the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to lead<br />

strange noises to be heard everywhere. No life can be seen anywhere, this<br />
place is dead to the world and seems to not to have seen the living in<br />

Nearing The Top of the Mountain<br />

distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and the<br />
biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life<br />
anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that of<br />
the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to lead<br />

A Path In The Mountains<br />
    The path leads higher up in to the mountains away from civilization.<br />
The summit is still completely obscured by fog but the wind seems to be<br />
growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is none<br />
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the remote<br />
location of the mountain. Despite the wind there is an eerie stillness that<br />
seems to hint at lurking danger.<br />

Nearing The Top of the Mountain<br />
    The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this<br />
distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and the<br />
biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life<br />
anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that of<br />
the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to lead<br />
around the peak of the mountain but it's difficult to ascertain where<br />
exactly one is in relation to the lower regions of the mountain.<br />

Atop The Mountain's Summit<br />
    The summit of the mountain would provide a spectacular view of the<br />
surrounding area, were it not for the dense fog which has surrounded it.<br />
The wind blows harder here than anywhere else, its strength is enough to<br />
chill any living creature to the bone. The only sign of life which exists<br />
is a small tent which is miraculously set up atop this peak. A small tunnel<br />
seems to run down the center of the mountain, and turning around, you<br />
notice the path which lead you here has vanished.<br />

A Path Around A Mountain<br />
    The path seems to run around the base of the ancient mountain. No life<br />
can be seen anywhere, it is as if all that was living simply vanished. The<br />
path seems well kept but there is little to no wear. Fierce winds gust from<br />
every direction, making the mountain even more formidable. A dense fog<br />
hangs over the top of the mountain preventing a better view of the<br />

A Path In The Mountains<br />
    The path leads higher up in to the mountains away from civilization.<br />
The summit is still completely obscured by fog but the wind seems to be<br />
growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is none<br />
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the remote<br />
location of the mountain. Despite the wind there is an eerie stillness that<br />
seems to hint at lurking danger.<br />

Nearing The Top of the Mountain<br />
    The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this<br />
distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and the<br />
biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life<br />
anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that of<br />
the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to lead<br />
around the peak of the mountain but it's difficult to ascertain where<br />
exactly one is in relation to the lower regions of the mountain.<br />

Atop The Mountain's Summit<br />
    The summit of the mountain would provide a spectacular view of the<br />
surrounding area, were it not for the dense fog which has surrounded it.<br />
The wind blows harder here than anywhere else, its strength is enough to<br />
chill any living creature to the bone. The only sign of life which exists<br />
is a small tent which is miraculously set up atop this peak. A small tunnel<br />
seems to run down the center of the mountain, and turning around, you<br />
notice the path which lead you here has vanished.<br />

    An enormous mountain rising high into the sky just north of here,<br />
blotting out the horizon. The path leading to the foot of the mountain is<br />
littered with large boulders and smaller rock cast off from the mountain<br />
itself. To the south, the eastern gate of Old Tarsis welcomes you into the<br />

stretch out into forever, and it isn't likely that you would find any<br />
refreshment in this sandy wasteland. The eastern gates of Old Tarsis just<br />

East Gate<br />
    All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and<br />
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have<br />
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These gates<br />
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has broken it<br />
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends in a<br />
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once<br />

    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />

A Path In The Mountains<br />
    The path leads higher up in to the mountains away from civilization.<br />
The summit is still completely obscured by fog but the wind seems to be<br />
growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is none<br />
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the remote<br />
location of the mountain. Despite the wind there is an eerie stillness that<br />
seems to hint at lurking danger.<br />

biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life<br />

    The path leads higher up in to the mountains away from civilization.<br />
The summit is still completely obscured by fog but the wind seems to be<br />
growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is none<br />
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the remote<br />
location of the mountain. Despite the wind there is an eerie stillness that<br />
seems to hint at lurking danger.<br />

it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />

A Shattered Gate<br />
    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted<br />
solid.<br />

    The city gates of Old Tarsis stand to the north, while the rooftops of<br />
the city itself cover the horizon. The burning sands of the desert to the<br />
east appear much less inviting than the city to the north. Likewise, the<br />
murky swamps west of here are dark and thick with vegetation growing up out<br />
of the waters.<br />

    The rolling dunes of the arid desert to the east continue off to the<br />
horizon. A few small patches of dried shrubbery and small collections of<br />
cacti appear to be the only living things out in that sandy wasteland. The<br />

    To the west there appears to an oasis, which seems odd given the bleak<br />
nature of the desert. Signs of life can be seen in this area, which is in<br />
stark contrast to the rest of the desert. The heat is not as intolerable as<br />
in other parts of the desert although it is hardly comfortable.<br />

every turn. Sand is everywhere and makes the desert seem endless. It is<br />
impossible to get a bearing on where the desert starts and stops due to the<br />
endless dunes in all directions. The unbearable heat is exacerbated by the<br />
stale air and the lack of a breeze.<br />
You feel a strong wind blowing here.<br />

The Barren Wastes<br />
    The desert is incredibly barren and gives off the scent of death at<br />
every turn. Sand is everywhere and makes the desert seem endless. It is<br />
impossible to get a bearing on where the desert starts and stops due to the<br />
endless dunes in all directions. The unbearable heat is exacerbated by the<br />
stale air and the lack of a breeze.<br />

which emanates from a small cluster of tents set up along the north side of<br />

which emanates from a small cluster of tents set up along the north side of<br />
the lake. Bubbles occasionally burst from the water, as if escaping from<br />
some underground area.<br />

    To the west there appears to an oasis, which seems odd given the bleak<br />
nature of the desert. Signs of life can be seen in this area, which is in<br />
stark contrast to the rest of the desert. The heat is not as intolerable as<br />
in other parts of the desert although it is hardly comfortable.<br />

Endless Fields of Sand<br />
    Nothing but sand can be seen in every direction. This desert is truly<br />
bleak and miserable. The agonizing heat in culmination with the stale and<br />
stagnant air makes it almost impossible to survive let alone function.<br />
There is no life to be seen anywhere.<br />

nature of the desert. Signs of life can be seen in this area, which is in<br />
stark contrast to the rest of the desert. The heat is not as intolerable as<br />
in other parts of the desert although it is hardly comfortable.<br />

Surrounded by Sand<br />
    There is nothing but sand as far as the eye can see. There are no<br />
carrion birds in the sky nor is there any plant life. This is truly a place<br />
of death where nothing can survive. The stale and stagnant air only makes<br />
the heat more noticeable.<br />

every turn. Sand is everywhere and makes the desert seem endless. It is<br />
impossible to get a bearing on where the desert starts and stops due to the<br />
endless dunes in all directions. The unbearable heat is exacerbated by the<br />
stale air and the lack of a breeze.<br />

A Pathway Out Of The Desert<br />
    There is a noticeable path atop this large sand dune, apparently<br />
leading out of the desert to a more hospitable climate. To the west you can<br />
barely make out the derelict spires of a large city.<br />

Before A Parched Wasteland<br />
    The rolling dunes of the arid desert to the east continue off to the<br />
horizon. A few small patches of dried shrubbery and small collections of<br />
cacti appear to be the only living things out in that sandy wasteland. The<br />
gates to the city of Old Tarsis stand just to the west of here, a much more<br />
inviting destination than the desert.<br />

A Shattered Gate<br />
    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted<br />

inviting destination than the desert.<br />

A Shattered Gate<br />
    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted<br />
solid.<br />

while a smaller road runs from the stables to the east, towards the Tarsis<br />
wastelands to the west.<br />

A Path Out Of The Swamp<br />
    As you manage to stumble out of the swamp, the foul smell which has<br />
plagued you starts to fade. Your feet squelch as you leave the muck and<br />
begin to cross a small field, which has sprung up on the edge of the swamp.<br />
Small black flowers speckle the ground, and their aroma begins to have a<br />
soporific effect upon you.<br />

    Finally! A breath of fresh air. You breathe in the salty air, and no<br />
longer detect any trace of decay in your nostrils. Behind you, the swamp<br />
menaces, it's tall trees beckoning you as they sway in the wind. However,<br />
as you peer ahead, you notice that the grass underfoot begins to turn<br />
slowly into sand, and you think you can make out a beach ahead of you.<br />

Overlooking The Ocean<br />
    Having navigated the steep sand dune, you find yourself atop it amidst<br />
the scrub brush. The ocean stretches on for miles and miles in front of<br />
you, and the wind whispers sweet nothings as it stirs across the dunes and<br />
kicks up sand. You notice that there is a small tent set up atop the dunes,<br />
as well as what appears to be a thin layer of grass, which covers a hole<br />
leading down into the heart of the dune itself.<br />

A Sandy Beach<br />
    You stand upon the shores of a beautiful beach. The waves slowly nip at<br />
your heels, and you quickly move higher up on the shore. Around you birds<br />
fly, and fish leap out of the water, towards the sky.<br />

A Breath of Fresh Air<br />
    Finally! A breath of fresh air. You breathe in the salty air, and no<br />
longer detect any trace of decay in your nostrils. Behind you, the swamp<br />
menaces, it's tall trees beckoning you as they sway in the wind. However,<br />
as you peer ahead, you notice that the grass underfoot begins to turn<br />
slowly into sand, and you think you can make out a beach ahead of you.<br />
A man stands here, ready to prepare you for the tournament.<br />

    As you manage to stumble out of the swamp, the foul smell which has<br />
plagued you starts to fade. Your feet squelch as you leave the muck and<br />
begin to cross a small field, which has sprung up on the edge of the swamp.<br />
Small black flowers speckle the ground, and their aroma begins to have a<br />
soporific effect upon you.<br />

    Finally! A breath of fresh air. You breathe in the salty air, and no<br />
longer detect any trace of decay in your nostrils. Behind you, the swamp<br />
menaces, it's tall trees beckoning you as they sway in the wind. However,<br />
as you peer ahead, you notice that the grass underfoot begins to turn<br />
slowly into sand, and you think you can make out a beach ahead of you.<br />

    Having navigated the steep sand dune, you find yourself atop it amidst<br />
the scrub brush. The ocean stretches on for miles and miles in front of<br />
you, and the wind whispers sweet nothings as it stirs across the dunes and<br />
kicks up sand. You notice that there is a small tent set up atop the dunes,<br />
as well as what appears to be a thin layer of grass, which covers a hole<br />
leading down into the heart of the dune itself.<br />

The Oasis<br />
    In the middle of this barren wasteland, you have stumbled across a<br />
green and fertile patch of land. Animals of all sorts gather around the<br />
oasis to drink and make merry. The desert is alive with the sound of music,<br />
which emanates from a small cluster of tents set up along the north side of<br />
the lake. Bubbles occasionally burst from the water, as if escaping from<br />
some underground area.<br />

By the Oasis<br />
    To the south there appears to an oasis, which seems odd given the bleak<br />
nature of the desert. Signs of life can be seen in this area, which is in<br />
stark contrast to the rest of the desert. The heat is not as intolerable as<br />
in other parts of the desert although it is hardly comfortable.<br />

A Huge Desert<br />
    The desert seems huge an unending, there is life no where to be found.<br />
The air is still and stagnant while the heat is almost unbearable. One<br />
expects a barren waste in a desert but this desert has nothing but sand in<br />
all directions.<br />

Before A Parched Wasteland<br />
    The dry expanse of the desert covers the horizon, spotted with<br />
occasional patches of dried shrubbery and cacti. The rolling dunes seem to<br />
stretch out into forever, and it isn't likely that you would find any<br />
refreshment in this sandy wasteland. The eastern gates of Old Tarsis just<br />
north of here, seem much more inviting.<br />

Before The Ruined Gate<br />
    The city of Old Tarsis spreads out west of here, through the large<br />
gates leading into the city. Further south, an arid desert wasteland<br />
stretches off to the horizon, dotted with cacti, and dried shrubbery. The<br />
northern horizon is dominated by a towering mountain, rising majestically<br />
into the sky.<br />

    An enormous mountain rising high into the sky just north of here,<br />
blotting out the horizon. The path leading to the foot of the mountain is<br />
littered with large boulders and smaller rock cast off from the mountain<br />
itself. To the south, the eastern gate of Old Tarsis welcomes you into the<br />
city.<br />

A Path Around A Mountain<br />
    The bleak looking mountain shoots up into the air, seeming to pierce<br />
the sky. It is difficult to see the top of the mountain due to the haze<br />
that seems to be hanging around the mountain. Fierce winds blow causing<br />
strange noises to be heard everywhere. No life can be seen anywhere, this<br />
place is dead to the world and seems to not to have seen the living in<br />
eons. There is a feeling of danger that hangs over the mountain, obviously<br />
one should tread lightly.<br />

side of the mountain is not distinguishable from the west side of the<br />

which seems to hang over the peak. Fierce winds howl throughout the<br />

Nearing The Top of the Mountain<br />
    The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this<br />
distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and the<br />
biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life<br />
anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that of<br />
the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to lead<br />

A Path In The Mountains<br />
    The path leads higher up in to the mountains away from civilization.<br />
The summit is still completely obscured by fog but the wind seems to be<br />
growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is none<br />
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the remote<br />
location of the mountain. Despite the wind there is an eerie stillness that<br />
seems to hint at lurking danger.<br />

East Gate<br />
    All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and<br />
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have<br />
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These gates<br />
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has broken it<br />
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends in a<br />
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once<br />
stood tall.<br />

    Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an<br />
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this area<br />
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense<br />
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are hollowed<br />
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs have<br />
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with rubble.<br />

Wall Road<br />
    All that is left of the road to the north is a huge pile of rubble. The<br />
outer city wall has fallen inward, blocking the path to the north. A small<br />
road leads west, into the marketplace, and the cities east gate is just a<br />
short distance south from here.<br />

East Gate<br />
    All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and<br />
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have<br />
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These gates<br />
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has broken it<br />
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends in a<br />
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once<br />
stood tall.<br />
