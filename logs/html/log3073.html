		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Behind the Dragon's Skull<br />
    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant<br />
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the<br />
mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly<br />
pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem<br />
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem<br />
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.<br />

A Muddy Path<br />
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows<br />
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf<br />
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs<br />
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the<br />
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.<br />
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small<br />
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.<br />

A Hot, Muddy Spring<br />
    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes<br />
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the<br />
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the<br />
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this<br />
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat<br />
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of<br />
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may<br />
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area<br />

mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,<br />
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection<br />
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The<br />
path leads to the south and north, where a sickening smell seems to be<br />
coming from.<br />

The Den of the Armaboros<br />
    On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely<br />
sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy<br />
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,<br />
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection<br />
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The<br />
path through the den leads to the east, west, and north.<br />
A greenish-purple mist hangs in the air.<br />
