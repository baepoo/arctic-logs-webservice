		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Solace Square<br />
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by<br />
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their<br />
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing<br />
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot<br />
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the<br />
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge<br />
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A<br />
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the<br />
thick limbs which house the buildings.<br />

The Abyss<br />
    The deathly still silence of the air is broken occasionally by a lone<br />
tortured scream, chilling you to the bone and causing your skin to prickle.<br />
The emptiness around you is the purest black you have ever seen, yet it has<br />
no color. The empty world around you seems to shift constantly, leaving you<br />
dizzy and confused, wondering how you ever got here, and how you could<br />
possibly leave. You feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end,<br />
and suddenly you feel as though someone, or something, is watching you,<br />
waiting...<br />
Blood flows eternally from a fountain here in the emptiness of the Abyss.<br />
A blackened bulletin board materializes from nothingness.<br />
A black robed man stands here, patiently awaiting the Dark Queen's return.<br />
