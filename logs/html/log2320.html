		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Entrance to the Government Building<br />
     A large and busy hall greets you as you walk in.  There are people and<br />
draconians running around, running tasks for whomever is in charge.  Most<br />
of the people don't pay attention to you, thinking you are only mercenaries<br />
that have come to cast your lot with the armies of the Dark Queen.  The<br />
draconians, on the other hand, stare at you with contempt and hatred.<br />
There are two doors leading east and west.  Near the southern end of the<br />
hall, there is a small, spiral staircase that leads up.  Though this<br />
building was once used as a city hall, it has been converted to the<br />
headquarters of the Highlord's rear flank.<br />

The current mayor of Lemish is a draconian, whose disguise as the previous<br />
mayor fooled the citizenry into allowing the dragonarmies easy access to<br />
the city. It is apparent from looking at him that the disguise is no longer<br />
needed; his reptilian features can easily be seen. He glowers at you from<br />
bulging black eyes, quickly deciding if you are a potential ally, or a foe<br />
to be reckoned with.<br />
