		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this<br />
distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and the<br />
biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life<br />

the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to lead<br />

one should tread lightly.<br />

feet. To the north and west the trees are so densely packed that you have<br />

An Intersection Amongst the Trees<br />
    The path you were on branches off in three directions at this small<br />
intersection. Animals can be heard scampering through the treetops and<br />
every so often you catch a glimpse of a very large blur running past your<br />
peripheral vision.<br />

foot traffic here of late.<br />

A Turn in the Path<br />
    Just when you think the path must dead end, you notice that it takes a<br />
quick turn towards the north. It is impossible to tell how much farther the<br />
forest continues on for, but you reason that it can't continue on forever,<br />
can it?<br />
<br />
130H 123V 0C Exits:NW&gt; w<br />
A Small Path between the Trees<br />
    The path is small and overrun with stray branches. Huge trees tower up<br />
all around you, blocking the sky from your view. As with much of the forest<br />
there is a canopy of leaves and branches above you, cooling the forest off,<br />
and soaking up the heat of the sun. There is an eerie calm to the forest,<br />
and it is reminiscent of the eye of a hurricane.<br />

A Split in the Path<br />
    The paths splits here, one leading to the north towards the heart of<br />
the forest, the other leading to the east into the interior of the forest.<br />
Huge trees tower over everything, dwarfing all other entities in the<br />
forest. As always the ever persistent canopy blocks out anything but that<br />
which dwells under its protection. The forest seems to be a world unto<br />
itself, trapping those within it for its own ends.<br />

    The path seems to lead deeper into the forest, there's a stillness in<br />
the air as though violence can erupt at any moment. The silence is<br />
pervasive yet somehow comforting. Huge trees tower over the forest floor.<br />
One can only wonder at their age but clearly they most predate the<br />
cataclysm. The forest is thick and very little light filters through the<br />

Before an Ancient Forest<br />
    This small path is surrounded by trees that grow thicker to the north<br />
as it moves into a dark forest. The ancient trees reach high into the air,<br />
their wide trunks surrounded by healthy shrubbery. The path to the south<br />
leads toward the western gates of Old Tarsis.<br />
Helion Wreckor, Dealing the Damage is standing here.<br />
Santino, the Prodigal Son is standing here.<br />
Martinez is standing here.<br />
