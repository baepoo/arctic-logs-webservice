		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    The reception contains a small desk. A long hall leads behind the desk<br />

their journeys. A small stairway goes down towards what appears to be a<br />
lively tavern.<br />
You see a silver key sitting here on the ground<br />
A large board with numerous wanted posters tacked on it is here.<br />

The wonderful smell of spiced potatoes makes your stomach rumble.<br />
The Inn of the Last Home<br />
    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and<br />
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates<br />
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the<br />
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another stairway<br />
leads down to the forest below.<br />
Greer, Imperial is standing here. (flying)<br />

A Small Side Street<br />
    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers<br />
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds<br />
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly<br />
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.<br />
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to<br />
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the<br />
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.<br />
A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly<br />

Northern Avenue<br />
    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting<br />
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form<br />
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear<br />
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking<br />
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its<br />
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the<br />
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.<br />

You follow Greer south.<br />
Solace Square<br />
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by<br />
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their<br />
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing<br />
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot<br />
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the<br />
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge<br />
vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some sorts.<br />
A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the<br />
thick limbs which house the guild hall.<br />

The Solace Adventurer's Guild<br />
    The guild is full of adventurers of all types, who are trying to hone<br />
and perfect their skills. The walls are covered with racks of weapons and<br />
armour that are used in the training. Huge book cases also fill the room,<br />
containing numerous spell books and scrolls. There are even chests and<br />
doors that seem to be made specifically for practice by thieves and their<br />
lockpicks. One master of all skills oversees all the training and<br />
progression here. A small stairway leads down out of the tree and to the<br />
ground below. A hall leads north. The Hall of Justice is to the south.<br />
Greer, Imperial is standing here. (flying)<br />
