		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

slight variations in its path. A ways off to the north, you can see the<br />
crossroads that lie at the center of the area. To the south, you can make<br />
out the large tops of pavilion tents jutting into the air. Judging by the<br />
amount of tents, you guess it's probably a merchant caravan of some kind.<br />

    Leaving the dusty road behind you, you step into the midst of a large<br />

their wares to the travellers wandering by. Some approach you and show you<br />
their selection. To the south, the main portion of the caravan opens out<br />

Road Through the Camp<br />
    Winding its way through the jumbled and twisting tents, this road seems<br />
to be the proper path through all the chaos. Shouts from the merchants can<br />
be heard ringing out over the tops of the tents. Travellers pass by you on<br />
their way through the caravan. Some stop to buy the wares of the merchants,<br />
others pull their cloaks over their heads and walk along oblivious to the<br />
shouting.<br />

gotten much more persistent at trying to sell you something. You seem to be<br />
nearing the center of this place, as you can see crowds of people all<br />
around you now. Merchants and travellers alike push past you as you stop to<br />
gawk at some of the baubles and trinkets that are for sale.<br />

    You have reached the center of this camp and the throng of merchants<br />
has gotten almost unbearable. All of them shouting and yelling about the<br />
fabulous things they have to offer. The largest of the tents in the caravan<br />
lie to the east and west of you, and those seem to be the most well<br />
established places of doing business. To the south, the road continues to<br />
twist and turn through the tents and merchants.<br />

    The merchants and tents have begun to thin out, leaving only a dusty<br />
road thick with wagon tracks and horse prints. The dusty road leads to the<br />

north. The offensive smell of dung drifts to your nose from the large tent<br />
