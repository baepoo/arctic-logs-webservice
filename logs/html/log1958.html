		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Travelling The Plains<br />
    The plains get vaster as you delve deeper into them. Though mostly<br />
composed of weed, an occasional farmer can be seen tilling the land and<br />
nurturing his crops. Off in the distance, towards the east, thick columns<br />
of smoke rise into the air, giving signs of a recent battle. The road is<br />
hard and well-travelled. To the east you hear the sound of running water,<br />
of a fast flowing river.<br />

East Bank of the Vingaard River<br />

Fording the Vingaard River<br />
    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal<br />
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,<br />
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can<br />
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel<br />
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of<br />
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be<br />
wise.<br />

The West Bank<br />
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being<br />
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by<br />
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control<br />
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due<br />
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have<br />
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for<br />
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to<br />
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the<br />
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.<br />

The Tollhouse<br />
    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from<br />

road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main<br />
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for<br />
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large<br />
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the<br />
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's<br />
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.<br />
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,<br />

a city wall for Palanthas. The citizens of Palanthas don't think a city<br />
wall is very becoming of their beautiful city, they would rather show case<br />
their pride and risk their safety. Therefore the city gates are always<br />
open.<br />
