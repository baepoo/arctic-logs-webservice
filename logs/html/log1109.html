		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Following a Rushing Creek<br />
     The creek winds its way west through the forest. Clumps of maple<br />
leaves and pine needles drift lazily upon the crystal clear water. The<br />
rushing of the water along the bed would be almost comforting if not for<br />
the unnatural darkness that seems to grow as you plunge deeper into the<br />
forest.<br />

     The splashing of rushing water drifts in from nearby. Pressing past<br />

half its normal height. Dried, cracked mud falls from the lip of the bank.<br />

Wandering Through the Woods<br />
     The road leading through the forest has practically disappeared now. A<br />
few old few ruts in the dirt, likely made by passing wagon wheels, are the<br />
only lingering signs the road ever existed. Leafy green dog rose and<br />
elderberry hug the base of the trees. The tall stands seem to stretch on<br />
forever.<br />
