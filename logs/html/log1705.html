		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

You follow Ahmed down.<br />
The noise level increases dramatically as you climb down to the tavern below.<br />
The Crashing Boar Inn<br />
    This is a small, comfortable inn in the northern part of Tantallon. The<br />
walls are composed of large round stones cemented together. On the western<br />
wall is a large fireplace which provides ample light and heat to the room.<br />
Several round tables are spread about the area, and numerous patrons sit<br />
around them, chatting merrily as they enjoy their food and ale. A large bar<br />
sits in the northern part of the room, and numerous patrons are seated on<br />
stools in front of it, enjoying the local specialty or a steaming hot meal.<br />
On the far side of the inn, a large set of stairs leads upwards.<br />
A bulletin board covered with notes has been mounted on the western wall.<br />
Kow Bell, Clanging Victory of the Blood Sea Pirates is standing here. (flying)<br />
Mastiff, the Evil Loser is standing here.<br />

Kow flies east.<br />
You follow Ahmed east.<br />
Kingfisher Way North<br />
    The street you walk on has been cobbled with utmost precision, leaving<br />
not a single gap between the stones. Extending to both the north and the<br />
south, Kingfisher Way is one of the busiest streets in Tantallon, and the<br />
home of most of the stores in town. You see the town square lying close by<br />
to the south, while to the north you can see the street continuing into the<br />
distance towards the northern outskirts of the town. A lot of noise is<br />
coming from an inn to the west, and to the east you see a building with a<br />
sign marking it as the Tantallon tannery.<br />
A long sword lies on the ground.<br />

You follow Ahmed north.<br />
Kingfisher Way North<br />
    You stand upon a firm, well-made cobblestone street in the northern<br />
part of Tantallon. This portion of the street deviates slightly from the<br />
norm; instead of buildings on both sides, there is only one to the west.<br />
Glancing to the east, you see what appears to be a stockpile of waste and<br />
junk, and the terrible odor coming from that direction confirms your<br />
thoughts. The building to the west appears to have been vacated by its<br />
owner, as there is a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign in the front window. Given the close<br />
proximity to the town dump, it's not hard to figure out why nobody wants to<br />
live there.<br />
A dark longsword has been dropped here.<br />
The corpse of Fer is lying here.<br />
A single steel coin lies here. [3]<br />

walking by on his way home or to a store, as well as a few guards that<br />
stroll through on patrol, you can't see any other signs of life. However,<br />
the emptiness is somehow more peaceful than eerie.<br />

as it is called, is owned by a powerful Solamnic Knight by the name of Lord<br />
Curston. The fortress keeps a close watch over the region, ensuring that no<br />
evil can penetrate the town. Small deserted roads branch off to the east<br />
and west. To the south is Tantallon itself, while a cobbled path leads<br />

Crossing the Bridge<br />
    The sturdy wooden bridge has been built from long planks of durable<br />
pinewood, and is held together by thick, blackened iron bands that stretch<br />
horizontally across the bridge. Huge iron chains extend from the end of the<br />
bridge to reels within the castle walls, used to control the drawbridge,<br />
though from the rustiness of the links, it seems there has not been reason<br />
to close it for many years.<br />
