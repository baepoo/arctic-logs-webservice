		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it<br />
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits<br />
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the<br />
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and<br />
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the<br />
west is a meeting room.<br />

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and<br />
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of<br />
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark<br />
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the<br />
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and<br />
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on<br />
the tavern wall.<br />

    The alley runs parallel with traders street, and is really nothing more<br />
than a gutter between the tall buildings of Cannery Row and High Street.<br />
The narrow, unlit alley is obviously used as a shortcut between the two.<br />

shadows catch your eye. As you move along, you realize that your ears are<br />
ringing because you are listening so hard.<br />

    This is the entryway to the temple. It is lit dimly by a few scattered<br />
torches, which barely reflect off what appears to be the remains of several<br />
humans. Perhaps now is a good time to turn and head back out the Red Door<br />

The Vestibule<br />
    The main hall of the temple begins here near the entrance. There are<br />
torches that line each wall, ensuring a well-lit walkway. Faint sounds of<br />
footsteps can be heard to the east, but there is nothing there but a wall.<br />
The walls are red in tint with sigils on each side resembling the God of<br />
Greed, Hiddukel himself. The path leads north, further into the vestibule<br />
or south back to the entryway of the temple.<br />

    It is very apparent that this hallway is seldom traveled and even less<br />

contribute to its darkness with their smoke. There is a faint stench of<br />
foulness in the air that causes you to cough. The path continues to the<br />

    This is the entryway to the temple. It is lit dimly by a few scattered<br />
torches, which barely reflect off what appears to be the remains of several<br />
humans. Perhaps now is a good time to turn and head back out the Red Door<br />
south of here leading back out of this grim place. The path extends to the<br />
north, while to the east lies a plain wooden door.<br />

    It is very apparent that this hallway is seldom traveled and even less<br />
frequently cleaned. The torches that once lit this passage now only<br />
contribute to its darkness with their smoke. There is a faint stench of<br />
foulness in the air that causes you to cough. The path continues to the<br />
east and west.<br />

the air and doesn't seem to move. This comes as no surprise as there are<br />
both dead and living rodents block the vents. The horrible combination are<br />
enough to cause anyone to gag. The path extends east and west.<br />

of a single guard inside the temple. Some strange moans seem to be coming<br />
from a vent on the west wall. Southward there is a turn in the hallway,<br />

    Plentifully filthy, these quarters are the chambers of the Captain of<br />
the temple guards. There is a dirty cot in the northeast corner of the<br />
room. The floor of the room is littered with empty flagons which reek of<br />
old ale. On the north wall you make out a small hole in the wall. As you<br />
turn from the hole you get the feeling you are being watched. Your only<br />
exit appears to be back south through the huge door.<br />
