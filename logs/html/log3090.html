		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

The Dusty Arena<br />
    When you enter the Arena, you are amazed to see that it is merely a<br />
long, dusty hallway, with doors lining each side. It seems very long, but<br />
because the ceiling is open to the sky, the sun beats down and makes things<br />
hazy, as though you were in the desert. The walls of the hallway are smooth<br />
marble, and the floor is made of sun-dried mud, stained with dark blood in<br />
many places. From the many doorways, you hear sounds of battle, and from<br />
time to time you hear a long, agonized death-cry.<br />
A dark, shimmering portal stands before you beckoning you to enter.<br />
The image of a phantasmal abomination flickers in and out of view.<br />
<br />
404H 186V 1X 8.19% 2055C Mem:1 Exits:(NE)S(W)&gt; <br />
You utter the words, 'relocate'<br />
A Cramped Nook<br />
    This is a small cramped space, with black marble walls rising up from<br />
all directions, leaving little space for a person, let alone a party of<br />
adventurers. There seems to be no exit, until your foot slips and you<br />
almost fall into a large hole in the ground. Peering down, you attempt to<br />
make out any sign of life, but it is simply too dark.<br />
A dark, shimmering portal stands before you beckoning you to enter.<br />
