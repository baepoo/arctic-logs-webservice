		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

mountain giving it a greater sense of foreboding. There is no life anywhere<br />

lines of the living for quite some time.<br />

Nearing The Top of the Mountain<br />
    The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this<br />
distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and the<br />
biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life<br />
anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that of<br />
the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to lead<br />
around the peak of the mountain but it's difficult to ascertain where<br />
exactly one is in relation to the lower regions of the mountain.<br />

The wind blows harder here than anywhere else, its strength is enough to<br />
chill any living creature to the bone. The only sign of life which exists<br />
is a small tent which is miraculously set up atop this peak. A small tunnel<br />
seems to run down the center of the mountain, and turning around, you<br />

A Path Around A Mountain<br />
    The bleak looking mountain shoots up into the air, seeming to pierce<br />
the sky. It is difficult to see the top of the mountain due to the haze<br />
that seems to be hanging around the mountain. Fierce winds blow causing<br />
strange noises to be heard everywhere. No life can be seen anywhere, this<br />
place is dead to the world and seems to not to have seen the living in<br />
get pile corpseeons. There is a feeling of danger that hangs over the mountain, obviously<br />
one should tread lightly.<br />

    The bleak looking mountain shoots up into the air, seeming to pierce<br />
the sky. It is difficult to see the top of the mountain due to the haze<br />
that seems to be hanging around the mountain. Fierce winds blow causing<br />
strange noises to be heard everywhere. No life can be seen anywhere, this<br />
place is dead to the world and seems to not to have seen the living in<br />
get pile corpseeons. There is a feeling of danger that hangs over the mountain, obviously<br />
one should tread lightly.<br />

the lake. Bubbles occasionally burst from the water, as if escaping from<br />
some underground area.<br />
