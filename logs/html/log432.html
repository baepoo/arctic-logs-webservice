		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

centuries of deft elven druidic hands, reach skyward towards the heavens.<br />
Small patches of flowers line the road, with an occasional fern or bush. A<br />
small patch of green moss grows on the side of another ancient oak, forming<br />
a small phrase. The cobbled path, leading north and south, forms a tee<br />
intersection with a smaller path leading eastward. The town feels exactly<br />
like the forest itself, and the wildlife acts as if no one lived here. The<br />
town has a general happy feel to it, and you sense that the residents are<br />
contented with their existence within Sorinthalas.<br />

A Path through Sorinthalas<br />
     The tall oaks of the town known as Sorinthalas, carefully shaped by<br />
centuries of deft elven druidic hands, reach skyward towards the heavens.<br />
Small patches of flowers line the road, with an occasional fern or bush. A<br />
small patch of green moss grows on the side of another ancient oak, forming<br />
a small phrase. The cobbled path, leading north and south, forms a tee<br />
intersection with a smaller path leading eastward. The town feels exactly<br />
like the forest itself, and the wildlife acts as if no one lived here. The<br />
town has a general happy feel to it, and you sense that the residents are<br />

centuries of delicate elven hands, reach skyward, clawing at the heavens<br />
themselves. Small patches of flowers line the road, with an occasional fern<br />

     Glancing quickly all around, you wonder how the simple forested Loft<br />
Hills could hide a village of this magnitude. Undoubtedly hundreds live<br />
here within plain sight, and you wonder how a village of this size has been<br />
able to stay intact with Delphon and Neraka so close. Surely any<br />
insurrection from this village would require a full battalion of draconian<br />
soldiers. A small cobblestone road begins here, worn and shaped by<br />

    The path suddenly stops, and two large trees bar your way south. The<br />
forest grows considerably thicker here compared to the rest of the forest,<br />
almost as if forming city walls. The trees also appear to be carefully<br />
molded and shaped by a force much more intelligent and much less chaotic<br />

further down the faded path. Small fish swim to the surface of the creek,<br />
jumping at the occasional tick or dragonfly. The creek takes an abrupt<br />
turn, and resumes its intermittent course. The trees appear to have reached<br />
their maximum height, formidable to most adventurers. Farther south, a<br />

obviously at one time the center of life in the hamlet, as great attention<br />
was once lavished upon it, as evidenced by careful paths lined in rock<br />
which wind their way through the marketplace.<br />
