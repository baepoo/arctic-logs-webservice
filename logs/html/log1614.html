		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

been made to hide last night's brawl. Obviously, such violence is<br />
commonplace. Looking around, the locals hiss at you and sneer back into<br />
their watered ale. A long bar, once made from fine oak, stands against the<br />
far wall. The many ales are displayed in their kegs in a corner. Jeering<br />
and shouts can be heard from the backroom to the north.<br />

    The lane leads north-south, into the quiet and strange town. There is a<br />
small sign here, making you aware of the inn nearby. To the east lies the<br />
only stretch of greenery in Neraka - once. What was obviously a small park<br />
has been ruthlessly burnt, signs of campfires and tent markings suggest<br />
that a draconian camp has once been here.<br />

In View of a Dark City<br />
    The road cuts through the mighty Khalkists, covered in the prints of<br />
many boots. The road leads north past the heart of the Khalkists and south<br />
towards the dark city of Neraka. The mountain range looms high above,<br />
craggy and barren. Birds of prey can be seen hovering above, waiting for<br />
the carnage of war. The air is filled with a thick film, possibly coming<br />
from one of the semi-active volcanoes in the region.<br />

    To the north stands a rusty bronze gate, hanging slightly off its<br />
hinges. Stretching to either side of it stands an old rickety fence<br />
surrounding what appears to be a graveyard. To the east the trail leads to<br />
the western city gates of Kalaman, to the west it leads deeper into the<br />
fields, and toward the river.<br />

manure. Around you grass is blown in the wind, growing thicker as it leads<br />
into a lush forest to the west.<br />

strangely lush and thick in an area where fields are more common. The wide<br />

it makes its way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in with<br />

the estuary of the river to the northeast. The river is thinner here, banks<br />
herding the river on its course. On each of the north and south sides of<br />
the rivers, roads lead through the lands towards Palanthas and the Lord<br />

grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside<br />
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the<br />
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern<br />
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard<br />
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only<br />
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands<br />
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards<br />
the distant city of Palanthas.<br />
