		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Sub flies east.<br />
You follow Sub east.<br />
You have arrived at a fen. This is merely a floating mat on the bog and you<br />
suddenly become mired in the peat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sinful the imp flies in from the west.<br />
Mired in the Bog<br />
    Moving quickly through the bog, your foot suddenly catches on<br />
something beneath the water and you plunge head first into the murky water<br />
beneath you. Attempting to pick yourself up from the mud, you find that you<br />
cannot lift your feet. They are stuck fast in the mud and try as you might,<br />
you cannot pull them free. You can feel your feet slowly sinking into the<br />
mud, pulling you deeper and deeper into the water of the bog. Soon, the<br />
water will be over your head and you will not be able to breathe. You grasp<br />
and struggle to pull yourself free, but it only makes you sink quicker.<br />
Finding no choice, you stop struggling and sit still, waiting to die.<br />
A crimson imp, Sinful, flaps its flame-tipped, bat-like wings rapidly. (invisible)<br />
&lt;OXEN&gt; Sub the Male Gnome is standing here. (flying) (invisible)<br />
. . . is surrounded by 4 folds in space.<br />
&lt;BSP&gt; Villa is standing here. (flying) (invisible)<br />
. . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.<br />

Sub focuses harshly on Villa and utters the words, 'shards of arcana'.<br />
Sub slowly fades into existence.<br />
Sub beams proudly as his shard lacerates Villa's body.<br />
Villa shrinks in stature as Sub's shard cuts her.<br />
