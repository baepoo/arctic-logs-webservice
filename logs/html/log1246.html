		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

The Path of Puddles<br />
    Harsh winds and piercing rain pummels you as you make your way along<br />
this path. The path itself is more like a shallow river that leads north,<br />
towards what you assume would be the keep. Through the dense fog and the<br />
constant barrage of rain blurring your vision you can see the large gates<br />
to the keep a short distance off to your north. You hasten your steps,<br />
hoping to get out of this storm, either by forcing your way into the<br />
shelter of the keep, or by letting yourself get captured.<br />

At the Great Gate of Storm's Keep<br />
    Looming before you are the great adamantite gates of Storm's Keep.<br />
Detailing of lilies and borders of thorns accent the otherwise bland doors.<br />
Flanking the dark metal gates are high walls of blackened stone worn smooth<br />
by the constant beating of the rain. The wicked wind whips about your face<br />
wreathing about your body and chilling you to the bone. Lining the top of<br />
the wall are a couple of uninterested soldiers and a pair of stone<br />
guardians, shaped like dragons and carved to resemble the living. The<br />
overall affect is quite frightening and it puts an awkward weight upon your<br />
shoulders and quickens the already rapid beat of your heart.<br />

A Curious Landing<br />
    A large, smooth chunk of rock juts out from the island here overlooking<br />
the swirling and churning ocean. The landing seems quite safe and appears<br />
to be one of the favorite unloading spots for people coming to and from the<br />
island. Through the swirling mist and pounding rain you can barely make out<br />
the faint outline of a vast and dark keep to your north. It is hard to get<br />
a good focus on the keep from this vantage due to the strange weather that<br />
seems to have gripped the isle. There seems to be a path leading north from<br />
here.<br />
