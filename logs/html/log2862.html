		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and<br />
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates<br />
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the<br />
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another stairway<br />

In Front of the Fireplace<br />
    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern, but here is where that<br />
coziness is most felt. A bright blaze burns in the huge fireplace that<br />
fills the wall to the south. The extra heat doesn't seem to bother the<br />
people gathered around the largest table in the inn. They continue chatting<br />
among themselves as the waitress delivers them a fresh bowl of spicy<br />
potatoes and a new round of frosty bottles.<br />
