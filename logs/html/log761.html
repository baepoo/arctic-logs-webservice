		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life<br />
anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that of<br />
the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to lead<br />
around the peak of the mountain but it's difficult to ascertain where<br />
exactly one is in relation to the lower regions of the mountain.<br />

A Path Around A Mountain<br />
    The bleak looking mountain shoots up into the air, seeming to pierce<br />
the sky. It is difficult to see the top of the mountain due to the haze<br />
that seems to be hanging around the mountain. Fierce winds blow causing<br />
strange noises to be heard everywhere. No life can be seen anywhere, this<br />
place is dead to the world and seems to not to have seen the living in<br />

one should tread lightly.<br />

    The path seems to run around the base of the ancient mountain. No life<br />
can be seen anywhere, it is as if all that was living simply vanished. The<br />
path seems well kept but there is little to no wear. Fierce winds gust from<br />
every direction, making the mountain even more formidable. A dense fog<br />
hangs over the top of the mountain preventing a better view of the<br />

    The bleak looking mountain shoots up into the air, seeming to pierce<br />

that seems to be hanging around the mountain. Fierce winds blow causing<br />
strange noises to be heard everywhere. No life can be seen anywhere, this<br />
place is dead to the world and seems to not to have seen the living in<br />

72H 39V 1X 1C Mem:25 Exits:NSW&gt; wA Path At The Base Of A Mountain<br />
    The enormous mountain rises high into the sky before you, its peak<br />
hidden by the clouds high above. Wind whips through the path, coming from<br />
around the side of the mountain, making the path seem more dangerous as the<br />
chance of being blown from it increases. A rocky path moves away from the<br />
mountain to the west, while it skirts around the mountain to the east.<br />

72H 37V 1X 1C Mem:25 Exits:EW&gt; wBefore a Majestic Mountain<br />
    Towering high into the sky just east of here is a massive mountain,<br />
blotting out the sky. The hard stone surface of the mountain has been worn<br />
from decades of bearing the elements. Rocks and boulders of varying sizes<br />
litter the road here, before the mountain. Farther west from the mountain,<br />
as the rocks and boulders thin, the northern gates of Old Tarsis stand<br />
welcoming.<br />
<br />
72H 35V 1X 1C Mem:25 Exits:EW&gt; wBefore The Ruined Gate<br />
    The city of Old Tarsis dominates the southern horizon, the rooftops<br />
cutting into the sky. Trees and bushes growing to the west and eventually<br />
increase in frequency before turning into a magnificent forest. While to<br />
the east, small rocks and boulders cast off from the mountain in the<br />
distance litter the road, making travel difficult.<br />

    The thick brush and large, ancient trees surrounding the path grow even<br />
thicker farther west. The forest is alive with the movement of creatures,<br />
small and large alike, scurrying through the underbrush and across the<br />
treetops. To the east stand the northern gates of Old Tarsis, and a<br />
majestic mountain on the horizon.<br />

151H 59V 1X 1C Mem:27 Exits:ES&gt; sBefore The Wastelands of Old Tarsis<br />
    The large desert like area known as the tarsis wastelands rise before<br />
you to the east, once a nomans land of thieves and prostitutes, they now<br />
serve as an uninhabited boundary for the ruins of old Tarsis. A trail leads<br />
off to the north into a thick forest of ancient trees that climb high into<br />
the air. The path to the south leads into a dense swamp filled with thick<br />
vegetation and unbearable humidity.<br />
<br />
s151H 57V 1X 1C Mem:27 Exits:NES&gt; Before A Marshy Wetlands<br />
    The humid air of the swamp just to the south is thick, and smells of<br />
rotting plant life. Thick vines and deformed trees grow up out of the murky<br />
waters of the swamp, creating walls of vegetation. To the north the western<br />
gates of Old Tarsis stand at the end of the path.<br />
<br />
151H 55V 1X 1C Mem:27 Exits:NS&gt; sA Grassy Field<br />
    While a mild, yet still foul stench rises from the south, it is<br />
partially broken by a fresh wind, which comes in from the north. The field<br />
around you is full of green and vibrant grass, and while it is fresh and<br />
alive, it is also very, very damp. The path continues on a north south<br />
trajectory.<br />

151H 53V 1X 1C Mem:27 Exits:NS&gt; sA Path Out Of The Swamp<br />
    You stand on a small path before a great swamp which rises from the<br />
south. Your feet squelch as the ground turns into muck, and the small field<br />
to the north turns into sludge and swampgrass. Small black flowers speckle<br />
the ground, and the aroma of the flowers begins to have a soporific effect<br />
upon you.<br />
<br />
151H 51V 1X 1C Mem:27 Exits:NS&gt; sLost Inside A Brackish Swamp<br />
    Having stumbled into this foul swamp, you find yourself without ant<br />
bearings. No sunlight Penetrates the thick canopy of trees which creates a<br />
ceiling above your head. No air circulates through this dismal area, and<br />
every step causes you to sink a little bit more into the water which<br />
stagnates around you.<br />

strange noises to be heard everywhere. No life can be seen anywhere, this<br />
place is dead to the world and seems to not to have seen the living in<br />
eons. There is a feeling of danger that hangs over the mountain, obviously<br />
one should tread lightly.<br />

chance of being blown from it increases. A rocky path moves away from the<br />
mountain to the west, while it skirts around the mountain to the east.<br />

    The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to<br />
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this area<br />
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and common<br />
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands as<br />
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been torn<br />
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.<br />

    The stone tiles of this road have long since lost their form and<br />

Broken stone and gravel speckle the road, causing each footfall to create<br />
an eery &quot;crunching&quot; sound. The main road runs north, towards the city<br />
gates, and south, towards the fountain and city square. A smaller road<br />

of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are shattered<br />
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced<br />
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the city.<br />

once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has broken it<br />
