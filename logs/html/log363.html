		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

southward, humility washes over you. Whomever made it probably didn't want<br />

An Isolated Path<br />
     The familiar clatter and chirps of the wildlife fade as you travel<br />
further down the faded path. The stream, before intermittent, now travels<br />
directly north-south, staying above ground and widening. Small fish swim to<br />
the surface, jabbing at the occasional dragonfly or tick. The trees grow<br />
much larger here, with carvings in them, denoting presence of something<br />
unbeknownst to you. The path, once fairly visible, now fades off and<br />
becomes almost unnoticable to the unaided eye.<br />

     The soothing chirps of birds and the clatter of chipmunks greets you<br />
as you enter the dense forest, far north of Balifor, nestled in the Loft<br />
Hills Valley. Off into the distance, small woodland creatures playfully<br />
leap from tree to tree, not paying you any attention. A small intermittent<br />
stream twists and turns through the bottom of the small valley, beckoning<br />
you onward. Also, a few bizarre looking birds fly overhead, occasionally<br />
breaking the dense forest canopy. To the north the path continues, leading<br />
you out of the forest, and back into the rest of the world.<br />
