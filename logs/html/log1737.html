		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

This gate and guard post seems to be an effort to prevent this occurrence.<br />
Those leaving Solace venture east through the gate and into the wild forest<br />

Near the Shore of Newsea<br />
    Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty<br />
water into the air. Strong gusts from the north whip at your clothes and<br />
kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to<br />
the western horizon, all that can be seen are the waters of the Newsea.<br />
Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass<br />

West End of Bridge<br />
    Groaning loudly, the wood of the bridge slightly gives way as you step<br />
on it. In the distance, across the waters of silver, buried beneath a<br />
shroud of white, the thin wailing reverberates through the air. Ghostly<br />
shapes, high above, flit about in the maze of fog, like the noble steeds of<br />
a chariot they pull the wailing of the banshee across the lands. Over the<br />
bridge, both southward and northward, the river boils violently, bubbles<br />
burst spraying scalding water across the surface of the bridge.<br />

meeting the base of the mountain range. Westward, the Dragon Monument<br />

peasants that once lived here seem to have left and tried to stop outsiders<br />
from entering this area. Several burnt torches have been stuck into the<br />
walls, finding niches and holes in the crude furniture that has been used<br />
in a futile effort. It seems that had the barricade not been there, you<br />
could probably have found a way to get back to the main square from here. A<br />
tall, deserted house lies to the west, its door has been forced open and<br />
there is a faint smell of ashes and old smoke. A symbol of death appears to<br />
have been carved into the wood surround with a knife.<br />

    Groaning loudly, the wood of the bridge slightly gives way as you step<br />
on it. In the distance, across the waters of silver, buried beneath a<br />
shroud of white, the thin wailing reverberates through the air. Ghostly<br />
shapes, high above, flit about in the maze of fog, like the noble steeds of<br />
a chariot they pull the wailing of the banshee across the lands. Over the<br />
bridge, both southward and northward, the river boils violently, bubbles<br />
burst spraying scalding water across the surface of the bridge.<br />

    Dug deeply into the muddy bank, from this end of the bridge the<br />
structure looks to be quite secure. Made of thin planks, beads of water run<br />
across its surface, leaning over the sides, and then falling back into the<br />
river. From somewhere light flows through the pourous steam, a steady beam<br />
of golden wire that falls just on the other side of the river. Looking<br />
deeply into the shroud, across the river, two pearly beads hover in the wet<br />
air as if held aloft by something, or someone.<br />
