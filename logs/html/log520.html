		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

navigate with only a detailed knowledge of the coastline. This fact makes<br />
the presence of a good, sober captain a must in order for this ship to<br />
sail.<br />

at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for<br />
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up<br />
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden<br />
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor<br />
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the<br />
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of<br />
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.<br />

    You are standing in the middle of the putrid Balifor dump. Old fish<br />
crates and carcasses make this smell particularly unpleasant.<br />
<br />
440H 73V 15640161X 528C Exits:NS&gt; Death Row<br />
    The road leads east to the city jail, the start of the journey for many<br />
of the prisoners on death row. It is also their last. The dank smell of<br />
rotting flesh and unwashed bodies is not very pleasant. You force yourself<br />
to continue.<br />
<br />

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out<br />
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform<br />
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for<br />
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up<br />
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden<br />
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor<br />
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the<br />
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of<br />
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.<br />
The lord high executioner grins at you, fondling his axe lovingly.<br />
<br />

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the<br />
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and<br />
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded<br />
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing<br />
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed<br />
'Death Row'.<br />

races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of<br />
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark<br />
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the<br />
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and<br />
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on<br />
the tavern wall.<br />

<br />
440H 69V 15640161X 528C Exits:NESW&gt; sThe Pig and Whistle<br />
    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it<br />
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits<br />
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the<br />
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and<br />
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the<br />
west is a meeting room.<br />

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out<br />
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform<br />
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for<br />
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up<br />
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden<br />
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor<br />
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the<br />
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of<br />
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.<br />

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen<br />
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden<br />
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,<br />
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort<br />
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away<br />
