		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

A Junction of Paths<br />
    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The<br />
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside<br />
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the<br />
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern<br />
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard<br />
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only<br />
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands<br />
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards<br />
the distant city of Palanthas.<br />
A putrid wight, Dralan, watches maggots writhe within its abdominal cavity.<br />

South of A Junction of Paths<br />
    North of here you can see a junction of roads. South of you lies the<br />
Vingaard river and the ferry that leads across it. Around you the fields<br />
blow in the wind, and small animals scurry around. The road here is made up<br />
of rocks stacked together neatly.<br />

Banks of the Vingaard River<br />
    You are standing on the northern banks of the Vingaard river. The<br />
roaring river flows past you, splashing water near your feet. The river<br />
appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As you<br />
survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.<br />
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from the<br />
river there is a path heading north.<br />
