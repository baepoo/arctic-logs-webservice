		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    The stench of sweat and grime hits you like a charging remorhaz as<br />
you enter the room. Not surprising, given how active your clan has been<br />
lately. It seems like they have single handedly rid Krynn of the last of<br />
the dragons and pulled down all the strongholds of the greatest lords and<br />
leaders. Yet somehow more pop up each day and your Clan fights on to<br />
bring order and domination to the world. The bright fireplace warms the<br />
room and provides the light for you to see your way to the bar and check<br />
in desk. Several waiters and waitresses bustle too and fro, bringing the<br />
much needed ale and sustenance to the worn out heroes. A bell hop stands<br />
by the check in desk, ready to stow your gear. The concierge stands by,<br />
ready to collect your Clan contribution before you head upstairs to your<br />
room and rest.<br />

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the<br />
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames<br />
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,<br />
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems<br />
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar<br />
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors<br />
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will<br />
last forever.<br />

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the<br />
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames<br />
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,<br />
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems<br />
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar<br />
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors<br />
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will<br />
last forever.<br />

    The stench of sweat and grime hits you like a charging remorhaz as<br />
you enter the room. Not surprising, given how active your clan has been<br />
lately. It seems like they have single handedly rid Krynn of the last of<br />
the dragons and pulled down all the strongholds of the greatest lords and<br />
leaders. Yet somehow more pop up each day and your Clan fights on to<br />
bring order and domination to the world. The bright fireplace warms the<br />
room and provides the light for you to see your way to the bar and check<br />
in desk. Several waiters and waitresses bustle too and fro, bringing the<br />
much needed ale and sustenance to the worn out heroes. A bell hop stands<br />
by the check in desk, ready to stow your gear. The concierge stands by,<br />
ready to collect your Clan contribution before you head upstairs to your<br />
room and rest.<br />

The beautiful rhomboid geometry seen in each tile is distinctive of the<br />
finest dwarven masonry. From years of use, each tile has taken on a<br />
polished sheen to make any homeowner proud. The oak walls on the hallway<br />
are kept clean by a variety of custodians, and the ceiling is high with<br />
a classic skylight window, which at the right time of day can let in a<br />
fair share of sun.<br />

room and provides the light for you to see your way to the bar and check<br />

much needed ale and sustenance to the worn out heroes. A bell hop stands<br />

mother with a trail of children behind her. The stone huts spew thin, black<br />

the canyon during the day, and frozen solid at night. The railing is about<br />
five feet high, protecting travellers and their beasts of burden. The land<br />
to the north is hilly, and far off you see the great Khalkist mountain<br />
range glaring at you, their jagged peaks spearing eagerly at the sky.<br />
Peering below to the east, you can see the outlines of the Hedge. This<br />
