		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

A Cut Path<br />
    The grass suddenly seems to part, opening up to a large trail the leads<br />
on through the plains. Examining the grass, it looks as though it has<br />
purposely been cut down and hacked through, and kept at its short length.<br />
The path twists and curves through the dangerous plains and you can almost<br />
make out a thin trickle of smoke on the horizon. To the south, the grasses<br />
seem to envelope the path and cover it up, almost completely hiding it from<br />
prying eyes.<br />
The corpse of Locki is lying here.<br />
The corpse of Mahadeva is lying here.<br />
A small harp lays here.<br />
The corpse of Ebil the fearsome blue dragon is lying here.<br />
The corpse of Mleth is lying here.<br />
&lt;Myth&gt; Rehab the Male Gnome is standing here. (flying)<br />
. . . has a metallic luster.<br />
&lt;Myth&gt; Hanlon Phat Bottom, Making the world go round is standing here.<br />
. . . has a tough exterior.<br />
&lt;Myth&gt; Mormont the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here. (flying)<br />
