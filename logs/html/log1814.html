		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

The Wooden Shack<br />
    Despite the small dimensions from the outside, this shack is actually<br />
rather spacious in its interior. Wooden panels have been used to pin many<br />
parchments and notes, an empty mug lies on the big desk in the centre of<br />
the room. Various sea-faring devices lay scattered around the space. The<br />
shack probably houses whoever is in control of the docks.<br />

    Dock Road runs north and south here. It is bounded to the west by the<br />
ever growing docks of Port Balifor, temporary home to a large number of<br />
Krynn's finest trading vessels. To the east you see the bustling city of<br />
Port Balifor. Its tall buildings mar the beautiful skyline with their<br />
boxed, concealed rooftops.<br />

    Dock road is muddy here, probably from all the dirt tracked in by the<br />
pack animals and carts brought in from the surrounding countryside.<br />
Movement onto the docks themselves is blocked here by countless crates and<br />
barrels that are being stored here until the arrival of the ship on which<br />
they will be transported. To the east, numerous storefronts line the<br />
boundaries of the docks.<br />

    Dock Road and High Street meet here in a three way junction. As you<br />
observe the intersection, you note that there are numerous sailors<br />
staggering from the local bars to their ships at all times of day. You also<br />
notice traders conversing both with themselves and the local shopkeepers.<br />
They are buying and selling the wares that they use to make a living.<br />

    The fresh sea breeze blows cold against your unguarded face, its salty<br />
odour bringing with it the smell of the fisherman's catch. The deep blue<br />
ocean rolls its waves gently against the wooden jetties and piers. The<br />
slapping of water on wood is the only sound that can be heard above the<br />
wailing of hungry sea birds. The road leads along the sea-front, passing<br />
between small boats and rotting wooden shacks that house the hardy<br />
fishermen.<br />

    You stand here at the end of the Western Pier, fighting the crowd to<br />
get to your destination. This pier is by far the busiest and largest of the<br />
three major piers belonging to the city, and the immense rush of people<br />
serves as a testament to this fact. You are thankful for the presence of<br />
the Balifor Watchmen on the docks, as you are almost too busy gazing at<br />
strange travelers to watch your own purse.<br />
