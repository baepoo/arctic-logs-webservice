		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    A dark blue carpet runs from the doors to what appears to be the temple<br />
itself, to the south. Through the stone archway can be seen vast rows of pews.<br />

come to clear their consciences. Eastwards is a long, dimly lit hall.<br />

    The dimly lit room is tight and cramped. It wasn't meant for more than two<br />
people - the sinner and the priest. There is a wall separating one side of the<br />

maybe the priest is just ugly.<br />

Entrance Hall<br />
    A dark blue carpet runs from the doors to what appears to be the temple<br />
itself, to the south. Through the stone archway can be seen vast rows of pews.<br />
To your west appears to be some sort of confessional, where the town's sinners<br />
come to clear their consciences. Eastwards is a long, dimly lit hall.<br />
A short, fat guard leans against the wall here, sweating.<br />

In the Hall<br />
    This is the western side of the residential hallway. Two wooden doors, to<br />
your north and south, appear to be the entrance to the priests' quarters. The<br />
door to the north is of particular interest. It is larger and more sturdy<br />
looking than the other. It is also marked with a strange, archaic symbol.<br />
Torches are mounted next to each door, in a metal torchholder. The blue-<br />
carpeted hallway runs farther east to a bend in the hallway, and west to the<br />
temple entranceway.<br />

The Reception<br />
    The reception contains a small desk. A long hall leads behind the desk<br />

their journeys. A small stairway goes down towards what appears to be a<br />
lively tavern.<br />
A few scattered pieces of corn lie on the ground.<br />
