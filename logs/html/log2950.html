		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form<br />
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear<br />
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking<br />
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its<br />

Solace Square<br />
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by<br />
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their<br />
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing<br />
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot<br />
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the<br />
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge<br />
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A<br />
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the<br />
thick limbs which house the buildings.<br />

Southern Avenue<br />
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and<br />
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of<br />
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of<br />
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has<br />
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is<br />
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into<br />
other parts of Solace.<br />

with Park Road and Forest Lane here. There is a small opening in the trees<br />
above that allows a view of the sky above. A small breeze blows through<br />
here and you inhale deeply. Southern Avenue leads north and south from the<br />
