		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    Northern Avenue intersects Perimeter Street here. The avenue leads<br />

Solace Square<br />
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by<br />
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their<br />
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing<br />
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot<br />
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the<br />
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge<br />
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A<br />
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the<br />
thick limbs which house the buildings.<br />
A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly<br />

On a Vallenwood Tree Above Solace Square<br />
    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to<br />
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,<br />
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have<br />
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.<br />
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring<br />
vallenwood tree.<br />

On a Vallenwood Bough<br />
    The bough of this vallenwood tree is wide enough to allow ten people to<br />
walk across side by side. You notice a small temple to the east with scores<br />
of people moving in and out, heads bowed. to the west, devout knights seek<br />
solace and divine intervention in a shrine built into a branch. To the<br />
south the bough climbs upward at forty-five degrees, but footholds and<br />
handholds allow for easy progress upwards.<br />

The Temple of Healing Arts<br />
    You are stunned by the beauty and majesty of this temple. How it was<br />
built, in such a small room, is beyond your comprehension. High vaulted<br />
ceilings rise where you would expect to see the thick branches of the<br />
vallenwood. You see a large ivory altar and fall in line with the many<br />
adventurers awaiting their turn to worship. A small door leads west.<br />
Lady Camilla walks around gracefully as she blesses the congregation.<br />
