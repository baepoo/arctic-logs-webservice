		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />

enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />

The Tarsis Dump<br />
    A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful<br />
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the wind is<br />
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been<br />
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn cart<br />
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing stirs.<br />
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of what<br />
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of their<br />
once peaceful lives covered with filth.<br />

Forgotten Stables<br />
    The eastern half of this huge building has collapsed onto itself,<br />
leaving half of the stables buried and unusable. Most of the horse stalls<br />
have been destroyed or fallen to ruin. This chamber has not seen a horse<br />
for several ages, but the smells normally associated with horses still<br />
lingers here.<br />

A Crossroads<br />
    Once, the smell of the stables to the east filled the air with the<br />
familiar odors of horses with just a hint of manure, now the air here<br />
smells of stale dust. The South Gate of Tarsis lies just to the south,<br />
while a smaller road runs from the stables to the east, towards the Tarsis<br />
wastelands to the west.<br />

    A massive, charred crater is all that remains of the southeastern part<br />
of the city. Whatever struck this city and left it in its ruined state must<br />
have rivaled the destructive force of the Cataclysm to have levelled this<br />
large a section of the city. Despite it's poor condition, the road leading<br />
west is in much better condition than the road that once lead eastward.<br />

Old Tarsis Square<br />
    Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis<br />
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken shell<br />
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are shattered<br />
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced<br />
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the city.<br />

Wall Road<br />
    Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of<br />

surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city, bringing<br />

blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road<br />
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.<br />

A Shattered Road<br />
    The state of the road has long since fallen from its former grace. This<br />
once busy, bustling market road has seen few travelers in recent times.<br />
Skeletons of the buildings that once bordered the road are all that is<br />
left, save the restaurant to the east that has somehow, miraculously<br />
survived all this time.<br />

fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken shell<br />
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are shattered<br />
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced<br />
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the city.<br />

Before the Library<br />
    Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to<br />
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the Great<br />
Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging from<br />
its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone<br />
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of time<br />
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from invaders is<br />
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.<br />

North Gate<br />
    The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to<br />
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this area<br />
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and common<br />
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands as<br />
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been torn<br />
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.<br />

The Tarsis Dump<br />
    A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful<br />
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the wind is<br />
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been<br />
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn cart<br />
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing stirs.<br />
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of what<br />
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of their<br />
once peaceful lives covered with filth.<br />

A twisted look of pain appears on Paus's face as he suddenly discovers Tsu Wei's knife in his back.<br />
Twinkling lights surround Paus and he disappears.<br />
You feel a sharp pain, then nothing, as someone's knife enters your back.<br />
Twinkling lights surround you and cover your body entirely.<br />
When they disappear, you find yourself somewhere else.<br />
Lie still, you are dead.<br />
That Really did HURT!<br />
You wish your wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!<br />
