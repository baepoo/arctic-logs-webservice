		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off to<br />
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie<br />
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses<br />
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is<br />

been set up to protect the fields, while to the west a thick forest,<br />

sounds of wildlife are audible.<br />

plains south of here. The river stretches out a little ways north of you as<br />
it makes it's way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in with<br />
sandy dunes. Scattered among the dunes are pieces of driftwood that have<br />
been washed up over the years from storms off the ocean.<br />

The Vingaard River<br />
    The mighty Vingaard river rushes past you as it rushes through the<br />
plains to the south. There is a heavy sent of saltwater to the air, marking<br />
the estuary of the river to the northeast. The river is thinner here, banks<br />
herding the river on its course. On each of the north and south sides of<br />
the rivers, roads lead through the lands towards Palanthas and the Lord<br />

roaring river flows past you, splashing water near your feet. The river<br />
appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As you<br />

grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside<br />
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the<br />
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern<br />
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard<br />
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only<br />
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands<br />
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards<br />
the distant city of Palanthas.<br />

Palanthas Highway<br />
     This road weaves its way through the Vingaard Mountains through the<br />
only known pass.  At its southern end is the High Clerists Tower.  From<br />
there it leads north to the jewel of Solamnia, the city of Palanthas. A<br />
small trail leads to the northeast through a small patch of trees, you<br />
cannot see what is beyond.  The road continues to the north and south.<br />

Intersection of Markham Avenue and Barclay Road<br />
     This intersection is the junction of the two largest streets in<br />
Palanthas New City. Markham Avenue runs north-south, while Barclay Road<br />
runs east-west. This is the residential part of Palanthas, many families<br />
have settled down in New City. The stables are also located not far from<br />
here, directly to the west, as a matter of fact.<br />

Outside the Southern Gates of Palanthas<br />
     You are outside the city gates of Palanthas. There really isn't much<br />
of a city wall for Palanthas. The citizens of Palanthas don't think a city<br />
wall is very becoming of their beautiful city, they would rather show case<br />
their pride and risk their safety. Therefore the city gates are always<br />
open.<br />

I received the following notice from Twinlark's manager (Lazarus):<br />
<br />
    &quot;i'm going to take twinlark's crash today as a sign i should<br />
    visit and clean off it's fans and ducts and such, i haven't been<br />
    there in a while. i'll also install a new kernel with serial<br />
    console support. This will happen during lunch time (PST)<br />
    sometime next week...&quot;<br />
<br />
Please expect an interruption of the game while this maintainance is<br />
carried out. Please do not flood us with emails begging to put the game<br />
back during the machine's downtime, we will not get them until after the<br />
fact anyway. If I get anymore information, I'll be sure to pass it along.<br />
