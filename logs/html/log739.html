		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

The Knights' High Road<br />
    Stretching out from horizon to horizon, the Knights' High Road passes<br />
through the Solamnic Plain, connecting the city of Vingaard with the lord<br />
city of Palanthas. The shining jewel of Solamnia, Palanthas lies far to the<br />
west and north, beyond Westgate Pass in the Vingaard Mountains, while the<br />
city of Vingaard lies east-south-east of here. The tall grasses of the<br />
plains seem to go on forever, gently swaying back and forth with the<br />
breeze. Barely visible far to the west are a few mountain peaks.<br />

Near the Virkhus Hills<br />
    The road continues from here, traveling to the north and south. The<br />
vast Solamnic Plain stretches out into the eastern horizon, while the<br />
Virkhus hills lie to the west and north. Tall grasses along side sway<br />
gently in the wind. The Knights' High Road, the main link between Vingaard<br />
to the east and Palanthas to the west, extends eastward far beyond your<br />
vision. The road is wide and obviously heavily traveled, though traffic<br />
seems to be dwindling as reports of war gain credibility.<br />
