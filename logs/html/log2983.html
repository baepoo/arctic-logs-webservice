		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Sorcerers with Mordred's caliber are usually much older, but this is an<br />

of draconians. If it were not for the mystics, he would have completed much<br />
of his work. Mordred senses your presence, and without lifting his head, he<br />

     You now stand in Mordred's personal laboratory where he and sometimes<br />
his trusted right hand man the alchemist conduct their experiments in<br />
making new and more powerful draconians. The room has a large table, on it<br />
you see various forms of experimental apparatus that you have never laid<br />
eyes on. Also in this room you see two large flat beds that appears to be<br />
used for conducting experiments. On the north wall, you see a large black<br />
board with many strange formulas written upon it. You get a creepy feeling<br />
that you are not supposed to be here.<br />
