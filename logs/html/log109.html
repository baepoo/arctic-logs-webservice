		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    The trees that line the route give a good indication of the ways to<br />
travel. To the north the huge vallenwood trees of Solace are visible,<br />
clearly marking the southern entrance to the town. The road to the south<br />
becomes wild and rocky as it leads through a wilder section of forest.<br />

The Seeker's Inn<br />
    A fire blazes in a large stone fireplace in the northern corner of<br />
the room. Several tables are scattered around, and several occupants of<br />
the inn are seated at the tables, ordering food and drink from the roving<br />
waitresses. A bard sits by the fireplace, a lute slung over one shoulder.<br />
The innkeeper smiles as you enter, and motions you to come closer so as<br />
to hear above the loud merrymaking of the inn.<br />
A large bulletin board is mounted on a wall here.<br />
A man in dirty green and brown garb studies the customers intently.<br />
An old man sits by the fireplace, a lute slung over one shoulder.<br />
The innkeeper is standing here, awaiting your request.<br />
