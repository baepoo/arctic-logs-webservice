		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    The path seems to run around the base of the ancient mountain. No life<br />
can be seen anywhere, it is as if all that was living simply vanished. The<br />
path seems well kept but there is little to no wear. Fierce winds gust from<br />

    The path continues around the backside of the mountain but the east<br />
side of the mountain is not distinguishable from the west side of the<br />
mountain. The upper regions of the mountain are blocked by a thick fog<br />
which seems to hang over the peak. Fierce winds howl throughout the<br />
mountain giving it a greater sense of foreboding. There is no life anywhere<br />
on the mountain just a few beaten paths that do not appear to have seen the<br />
lines of the living for quite some time.<br />

    The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this<br />
distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and the<br />
biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life<br />
anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that of<br />
the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to lead<br />
around the peak of the mountain but it's difficult to ascertain where<br />
exactly one is in relation to the lower regions of the mountain.<br />

    The path leads higher up in to the mountains away from civilization.<br />
The summit is still completely obscured by fog but the wind seems to be<br />
growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is none<br />
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the remote<br />
location of the mountain. Despite the wind there is an eerie stillness that<br />
seems to hint at lurking danger.<br />

    The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this<br />
distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and the<br />
biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life<br />
anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that of<br />
the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to lead<br />
around the peak of the mountain but it's difficult to ascertain where<br />
exactly one is in relation to the lower regions of the mountain.<br />

of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are shattered<br />

Broken stone and gravel speckle the road, causing each footfall to create<br />
