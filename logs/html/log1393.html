		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

The Courthouse<br />

courthouse. The ceiling has long since caved in, leaving the interior of<br />
the building exposed to the environment. The attached jail cells have been<br />
crushed by the building, but you see no signs of their former occupants.<br />
Most likely they fled during the chaos of whatever ravaged this city.<br />

for Tarsis. Even now, in its dilapidated state, the building still has an<br />
air of importance and authority. One of the main city roads lies to the<br />
west, while the road leads eastward, towards the cities former markets.<br />

collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with rubble.<br />

    Once, great scholars came to this library to scour over tomes<br />
containing knowledge of the arcane arts, history, science, mathematics and<br />
countless other subjects. Now all of that is lost. Whatever was not<br />
crushed, burned or otherwise destroyed has long since turned to dust. The<br />

up into small clouds with every footstep. The once-lush Tarsis Park lies in<br />
ruin to the north, and the entrance to the cities temple is to the west.<br />

A Path Through the Park<br />
    This dry, dusty pathy leads north-south through the old Tarsis park.<br />
This park was once full of life, a lush, vibrant forest rich with color and<br />
sound, but now it is a desolate, lonely place. The entire west half of the<br />
park has been replaced with a giant crater.<br />

North Gate<br />
    The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to<br />
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this area<br />
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and common<br />
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands as<br />
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been torn<br />
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.<br />

others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the city.<br />

here. Now, the only thing left of the building to the north is a pile of<br />

Before the Forge<br />
    Once, many warriors frequented this section of town. Between the<br />
weapons shop to the south, the inn just a short distance to the west and<br />
the bar to the north, everything a young warrior needed could be found<br />
here. Now, the only thing left of the building to the north is a pile of<br />
rubble and the shop to the south has long since been deserted.<br />

Outside the Tarsis Inn<br />
    The Tarsis Inn, to the west, is one of the few buildings that remains<br />
mostly intact. The sign that once hung above the inns door has nearly<br />
fallen from its perch: it hangs by a single hook now, ready to fall and<br />
shatter itself onto the cobblestone road.<br />

Near the Tarsis Wastelands<br />
    The broken road continues westward, towards the Tarsis Wastelands which<br />
was once known for the vagrants and criminals that occupied the area. Now<br />
it, like the rest of the city, is barren and desolate. A road branches off<br />
to the south, leading towards the cities inn, while the main road leads<br />
eastward, towards the city square.<br />

    The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to<br />
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this area<br />
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and common<br />
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands as<br />
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been torn<br />
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.<br />

its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone<br />
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of time<br />
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from invaders is<br />
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.<br />

once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has broken it<br />
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends in a<br />

indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this area<br />

population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are hollowed<br />

Wall Road<br />
    Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of<br />
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the<br />
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city, bringing<br />
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east is<br />
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road<br />
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.<br />

North Gate<br />
    The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to<br />
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this area<br />
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and common<br />
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands as<br />
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been torn<br />
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.<br />

North Gate<br />
    The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to<br />

and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and common<br />
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands as<br />

The Ruined Market<br />
    Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an<br />
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this area<br />
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense<br />
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are hollowed<br />
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs have<br />
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with rubble.<br />

East Gate<br />
    All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and<br />
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have<br />
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These gates<br />
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has broken it<br />
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends in a<br />

gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the wind is<br />

discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn cart<br />
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing stirs.<br />

once peaceful lives covered with filth.<br />
