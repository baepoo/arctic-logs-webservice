		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

A Shattered Gate<br />
    The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced<br />
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates. These<br />
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure that<br />
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city<br />
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical<br />
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still rest<br />
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted<br />
solid.<br />

Before an Ancient Forest<br />
    This small path is surrounded by trees that grow thicker to the north<br />
as it moves into a dark forest. The ancient trees reach high into the air,<br />
their wide trunks surrounded by healthy shrubbery. The path to the south<br />
leads toward the western gates of Old Tarsis.<br />

A Path in the Forest<br />
    The path seems to lead deeper into the forest, there's a stillness in<br />
the air as though violence can erupt at any moment. The silence is<br />
pervasive yet somehow comforting. Huge trees tower over the forest floor.<br />
One can only wonder at their age but clearly they most predate the<br />
cataclysm. The forest is thick and very little light filters through the<br />
trees.<br />
