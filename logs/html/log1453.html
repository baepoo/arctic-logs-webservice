		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

The Pig and Whistle<br />
    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it<br />
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits<br />
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the<br />
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and<br />
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the<br />
west is a meeting room.<br />

The Tavern Square<br />
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and<br />
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of<br />
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark<br />
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the<br />
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and<br />
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on<br />
the tavern wall.<br />

section of town.<br />

Traders Square<br />
    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen<br />
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden<br />
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,<br />
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort<br />
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away<br />
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the<br />
cobbled square.<br />
