		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Romis' Refuge<br />
    This seems to be the most lavish room that you have been in. The room<br />
is draped in expensive furniture. Several small busts of famous Krynn<br />
warriors line the eastern wall, their eyes all gazing at the center of the<br />
room. In the center of the room, there is a large, finely-crafted desk.<br />
Studying the room some more, you notice several paintings of the great<br />
minotaur king, Bul. The room has a nice, pleasant smell to it in general.<br />
The corpse of Romis is lying here.<br />
The corpse of an elite guard is lying here. [2]<br />

w<br />
Before the Great Doors<br />
    With the howl of the storm still in the air, you approach a set of<br />
large marble doors. The doors have been chiseled from some of the finest<br />
marble on Krynn, leaving you with a sense that there is not only power in<br />
this Keep, but also immense wealth. There is a large, black lily engraved<br />
into the doors, it's stem entwined around the handle of a battle axe.<br />
The corpse of a Warrior of the Lily is lying here. [2]<br />
<br />
325H 172V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NS&gt; The Descending Corridor<br />
    This section of the corridor is much damper and colder than the rest of<br />
the Keep. The candles on the wall have long since been removed, as the gale<br />
winds which blow in from the missing section of the western wall makes it<br />
impossible to maintain them. The wind and rain pelt down on you here as if<br />
you were outdoors, tearing away at your very soul. You notice that a single<br />
candle has been left in it's holder, but no flame burns on its damp wick.<br />
The corridors to the north and south seem much calmer and dryer, enticing<br />
you to quickly leave this section.<br />
<br />
325H 171V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NS&gt; I see no door to the west.<br />
<br />
325H 171V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NS&gt; The Training Hall<br />
    This appears to be the training room of the Keep. It seems rather<br />
well-kept. Gazing around, you notice that the floor is covered with several<br />
spots of dried blood. There is a large, oak cabinet with the symbol of the<br />
Lily set into the northern walling. By the size of the room, and the many<br />
blood stains and shattered weapons which lie strewn about, you realize that<br />
this is the training ground of the elite knights of the Keep.<br />
The corpse of a Knight of the Lily is lying here. [3]<br />
The corpse of a knight of the lily is lying here.<br />
Wicked looking black leg plates rest in a heap here...it glows blue<br />

325H 170V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:(N)ESW&gt; w<br />
Outside the Keep<br />
    This path, while not protected by the stone walls of the keep, appears<br />
to be scarcely affected by the storm which protects the keep. While you can<br />
see the effects of the storm, you feel only a moderately strong breeze. The<br />
path continues to what appears to be the stables to the north, and back<br />
into the mighty fortress to the east. A path leads around the keep to the<br />
south.<br />
<br />
325H 169V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NES&gt; s<br />
A Path Around the Keep<br />
    You can hear the clanging of metal, coming from a source a short<br />
distance away to the north. High above, embedded into the corner formed by<br />
the walls of theh keep, is a small platform, though you see no way to<br />
access it. It appears to be some sort of guard station.<br />
The corpse of a dragonrider captain is lying here.<br />
The corpse of a large red dragon is lying here.<br />
<br />

<br />
325H 168V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NW&gt; w<br />
A Path Around the Keep<br />
    The path around the keep is anything but spectacular. The ground shows<br />
signs of heavy usage and the walls of the keep rise to the east. The storm<br />
rages to the west, but you feel nothing on this path. This part of the path<br />
is pretty much the same as the rest of the path.<br />
Wicked looking black leg plates rest in a heap here...it glows blue<br />
A breast plate is lying on the ground.<br />
A tin hooded lantern has been left here.<br />
<br />
325H 167V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:ES&gt; s<br />
A Path Around the Keep<br />
    This path seems to be the main route of transportation for the soldiers<br />
of the keep that train in the courtyard. The stone floor showns signs of<br />
usage from humans and horses, as well as dragons. Lightning flashes off in<br />
the distance, reminding you of the storm that rages around this island.<br />
<br />
325H 166V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NS&gt; TICK IN 16 SECONDS.<br />
s<br />
A Path Around the Keep<br />
    This path appears to be used heavily. It seems that the front gates of<br />
Storms Keep is used as rarely as possible. The massive walls of the keep<br />
rise to the east, towering high above you. Looking around you note that the<br />
storm that rages around the keep seems to have no effect on the keep or its<br />
inhabitants.<br />
A hideous skull grins evilly at you.<br />
A breast plate is lying on the ground. [2]<br />

The Inner Courtyard<br />
    This area of the courtyard appears to be empty, although you feel eyes<br />
watching you. To the south is a huge wall, with a single archway leading<br />
back into the courtyard. The archway serves as a choke point; it would be<br />
an excellent tool to use in preparing an ambush. A path extends to the<br />
west, appearing to lead around the keep.<br />
<br />
325H 164V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:(N)SW&gt; s<br />
A Guard Station<br />
    This guard station serves as a buffer between the outer courtyard and<br />
the main keep. There is a small archway in the northern wall, and the<br />
courtyard extends in all other directions. The archway serves as a choke<br />
point: all access to the main keep passes through this station. If the keep<br />
were to be attacked, the intruders would have to pass through this arch as<br />
well, making it an excellent location for an ambush.<br />

The Center of the Courtyard<br />
    The tiled stone floor here is scuffed and scratched from excessively<br />
high volumes of traffic. A large stone fountain lies in the very center of<br />
the courtyard, offering refreshment to the knights as they train. There are<br />
three stone benches surrounding the fountain, offering the training knights<br />
a chance to rest before recommencing their training.<br />
A large, black fountain juts up in the middle of the market.<br />

<br />
325H 162V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NESW&gt; s<br />
Courtyard in the Keep<br />
    A constant veil of darkness is thrown over the courtyard of the keep<br />
caused by the clouds of the storm which always surrounds the keep. The<br />
large courtyard is over crowded with novices and knights in training. Few<br />
take notice of you, most disregarding you as more spies from the continent.<br />
The courtyard extends in nearly all directions before you, and further<br />
north you can see the main keep. Looking around you, you can't help but<br />
think that the keep could never be taken in a frontal assault, perhaps if<br />
Krynn had known of this threat earlier...<br />

325H 161V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NESW&gt; s<br />
At the Great Gate of Storm's Keep<br />
    Looming before you are the great adamantite gates of Storm's Keep.<br />
Detailing of lilies and borders of thorns accent the otherwise bland doors.<br />
Flanking the dark metal gates are high walls of blackened stone worn smooth<br />
by the constant beating of the rain. The wicked wind whips about your face<br />
wreathing about your body and chilling you to the bone. Lining the top of<br />
the wall are a couple of uninterested soldiers and a pair of stone<br />
guardians, shaped like dragons and carved to resemble the living. The<br />
overall affect is quite frightening and it puts an awkward weight upon your<br />
shoulders and quickens the already rapid beat of your heart.<br />
<br />
325H 159V 1X 10695C Mem:8 Exits:NS&gt; s<br />
The Path of Puddles<br />
    Harsh winds and piercing rain pummels you as you make your way along<br />
this path. The path itself is more like a shallow river that leads north,<br />
towards what you assume would be the keep. Through the dense fog and the<br />
constant barrage of rain blurring your vision you can see the large gates<br />
to the keep a short distance off to your north. You hasten your steps,<br />
hoping to get out of this storm, either by forcing your way into the<br />
shelter of the keep, or by letting yourself get captured.<br />
A small key of carved ebony lies here.<br />

A Curious Landing<br />
    A large, smooth chunk of rock juts out from the island here overlooking<br />
the swirling and churning ocean. The landing seems quite safe and appears<br />
to be one of the favorite unloading spots for people coming to and from the<br />
island. Through the swirling mist and pounding rain you can barely make out<br />
the faint outline of a vast and dark keep to your north. It is hard to get<br />
a good focus on the keep from this vantage due to the strange weather that<br />
seems to have gripped the isle. There seems to be a path leading north from<br />
here.<br />
Lady Sarah Meddaugh, Black Mage of Mysidia is standing here, fighting a wizard eye. (flying)<br />
