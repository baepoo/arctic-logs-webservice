		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Western Gates of Newport<br />
    The gates of this village are constructed of mighty vallenwoods imported<br />
from the northern forests. A pair of lanterns hang from each side and are<br />
continually maintained by the local guards for continuous light. The danger<br />
of attack from the dragon armies is always a threat in these parts. A sea<br />

The Outskirts of Newport<br />
    The Old Road is intersected here by the cobblestone road leading to the<br />
small fishing community, Newport. Beyond Newport is a bay of the New Sea,<br />
its waters stretching out across the horizon. The cobblestone continues to<br />
the north, signifying the beginnings of a major trade route to the towns of<br />
Solace and Haven further to the north. The majestic forests of the fabled<br />
elven capitol of Qualinost deepen to the southwest. If you travel south you<br />
can also come upon Pax Tharkas. If you travel north, you will hit the River<br />
White Rage.<br />

seen, surrounded on three sides by a bay of the New Sea. Fishing boats dot<br />
the waters of the bay, as Newport citizens toil away in their trade. The<br />

maples. Far to the south, the peace of the Kharolis Mountains rise in<br />

assume that villagers from Newport have cut them down for their fires and to<br />
create farm land. The forest is beginning to take back the land it has lost,<br />

    The dense forest around you occasionally places obstacles in your path,<br />
you cannot help but trip and fall. Fortunately the soft cushion of dead<br />

can be heard from the north. The road continues to the south, it seems as<br />

The Road to Solace<br />
    The trees that line the route give a good indication of the ways to<br />
travel. To the north the huge vallenwood trees of Solace are visible,<br />
clearly marking the southern entrance to the town. The road to the south<br />
becomes wild and rocky as it leads through a wilder section of forest.<br />

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the south. Two huge<br />
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and the gate is placed between<br />
these. The forest to the south looks much wilder and dangerous than the<br />
forest that houses Solace. Southern Avenue leads north into Solace itself.<br />

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and<br />
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of<br />
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of<br />
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has<br />
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. You also notice a small<br />
stairway which spirals down around the trunk of the vallenwood. The avenue<br />
also leads north and south into other parts of Solace.<br />

Solace Square<br />
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by<br />
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their<br />
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing<br />
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot<br />
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the<br />
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge<br />
vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some sorts.<br />
A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the<br />
thick limbs which house the guild hall.<br />
A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.<br />

Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking<br />
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its<br />
