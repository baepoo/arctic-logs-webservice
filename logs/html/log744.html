		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Market Square of Kalaman<br />
     This square is the busiest part of the city. People of all kinds walk<br />
the city square of Kalaman. Shoppers, merchants and wagons go through this<br />
square non-stop all day long. The air is filled with the smell of food,<br />
spice and anything else you can think of. It is almost impossible to<br />
stretch your arms here without hitting something or someone.<br />

Western City Gates<br />
     You are inside the western city gates. The gates are made of thick<br />

Beyond the City of Kalaman<br />
    Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two<br />
paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off to<br />
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie<br />
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses<br />
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is<br />
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.<br />

Before an Old Cemetery<br />
    To the north stands a rusty bronze gate, hanging slightly off its<br />
hinges. Stretching to either side of it stands an old rickety fence<br />
surrounding what appears to be a graveyard. To the east the trail leads to<br />
the western city gates of Kalaman, to the west it leads deeper into the<br />
fields, and toward the river.<br />

Near a Vast City<br />
    To the east, across some fields you see the city of Kalaman. You can<br />
smell a farm to your north, easily recognizable by the sweet smell of<br />
manure. Around you grass is blown in the wind, growing thicker as it leads<br />
into a lush forest to the west.<br />

Beside a Thick Forest    <br />
   To the east farms spread out across the fields. The air here smells<br />
heavily of manure. Along the eastern side of the trail a wooden fence has<br />
been set up to protect the fields, while to the west a thick forest,<br />
strangely lush and thick in an area where fields are more common. The wide<br />
path cuts north, further into the widening fields, and south towards a<br />
large city.<br />

Traveling the Plains<br />
    The trail leads through the plains to the north. To the south you can<br />
see farms to the east further down the path, which explains the horrible<br />
smell in this area. The tall grasses sway gently in the wind, and the<br />
sounds of wildlife are audible.<br />

    The trail here continues to the north and to the south. To the far<br />
north the Vingaard estuary is just barely visible. All around grass sways<br />

slightly barren, as if it has been grazed upon.<br />

plains to the north you can just barely see the Vingaard River. The grass<br />
here is blowing gently in the wind coming off the water. The ground here is<br />
slightly uncovered as some of the grass appears to have been razed.<br />

Curving Away from the Shore<br />
    The trail here heads towards the shoreline of the river, and into the<br />
plains south of here. The river stretches out a little ways north of you as<br />
it makes its way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in with<br />
sandy dunes. Scattered among the dunes are pieces of driftwood that have<br />
been washed up over the years from storms off the ocean.<br />

    North of you the river flows past toward the sea in the east. The<br />
shoreline here is sandy with the occasional clump of grass clinging onto<br />
it. Rocks and small sticks are strewn about, having been deposited here<br />
during the last flood. The trail here is very sandy.<br />

The Banks of the Vingaard River<br />
    The road runs to the very edge of the mighty river, before curving away<br />
to the south and east. A small pier has been built along the bank, used by<br />
passengers boarding the ferry that will carry them to the other side of the<br />
river. A small signpost has been hammered into the ground beside the pier.<br />
The road leads south through the Plains of Estwilde and east towards the<br />
Lord City of Kalaman.<br />

The Vingaard River<br />
    The mighty Vingaard river rushes past you as it rushes through the<br />
plains to the south. There is a heavy sent of saltwater to the air, marking<br />
the estuary of the river to the northeast. The river is thinner here, banks<br />
herding the river on its course. On each of the north and south sides of<br />
the rivers, roads lead through the lands towards Palanthas and the Lord<br />
City of Kalaman.<br />

Banks of the Vingaard River<br />
    You are standing on the northern banks of the Vingaard river. The<br />
roaring river flows past you, splashing water near your feet. The river<br />
appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As you<br />
survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.<br />
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from the<br />
river there is a path heading north.<br />

South of A Junction of Paths<br />
    North of here you can see a junction of roads. South of you lies the<br />
Vingaard river and the ferry that leads across it. Around you the fields<br />
blow in the wind, and small animals scurry around. The road here is made up<br />
of rocks stacked together neatly.<br />

A Junction of Paths<br />
    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The<br />
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside<br />
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the<br />
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern<br />
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard<br />
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only<br />
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands<br />
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards<br />
the distant city of Palanthas.<br />

    Winding its way through the windy and fertile plains, the highway<br />
stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and<br />
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their<br />
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the<br />
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds.<br />
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire.<br />

a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands<br />
