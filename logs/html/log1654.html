		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

    At the top of the stairs from the inn's lobby is a small room serving<br />
as a room registry. Belle sits behind a pine counter, quietly reading,<br />
until a customer arrives. Behind her is a long rack of wooden cubbyholes<br />
and hooks holding room keys. Long halls with many closed doors stretch to<br />
either side. It's quiet and well-kept here, conducive to a good night's<br />
sleep.<br />
A bulletin board with the heading 'Wanted' has been posted on the far wall.<br />
The fez atop this well muscled bouncer's head marks him a fierce adversary.<br />

The Crossed Arms<br />
    The low ceiling holds the smoke and noise close to the floor in this<br />
busy inn. A dozen long tables stand scattered about the room and a narrow<br />
stair in the back leads to the upper floor. Along the south wall, a<br />
fieldstone hearth holds a rotating spit. Several groups of adventurers are<br />
clustered about the various tables, each eying the others suspiciously and<br />
planning their campaigns in muted tones.<br />

Before a Humble Inn<br />
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a<br />
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the<br />
tunnel. This room is inteRESTINGly dim, and if not for the incredible<br />
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter<br />
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the<br />
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from<br />
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side<br />
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of<br />
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west<br />
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.<br />
