		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

The Seedy Inn<br />
    The blood stained floor is evident as soon as you enter. No attempt has<br />
been made to hide last night's brawl. Obviously, such violence is<br />
commonplace. Looking around, the locals hiss at you and sneer back into<br />
their watered ale. A long bar, once made from fine oak, stands against the<br />
far wall. The many ales are displayed in their kegs in a corner. Jeering<br />
and shouts can be heard from the backroom to the north.<br />
A large bulletin board is mounted on a wall here.<br />
Holly the barwoman is here, flaunting her body and eager to serve.<br />

The Reception<br />
    Although this inn does not look very reputable, at least it has warm<br />
beds and anyhow, it is safer than sleeping in the streets of Neraka. A<br />
small counter stands here with a little brass bell, although you should not<br />
use it for fear that the receptionist gets angry. It looks as if she has<br />
had a hard day already.<br />
The receptionist sits here, looking very flustered.<br />
Standing in shadows, a draconian guard hisses occasionally.<br />

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by<br />
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their<br />
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing<br />
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot<br />
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the<br />
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge<br />
vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some sorts.<br />

Death Row<br />
    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the<br />
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and<br />
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded<br />
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing<br />
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed<br />
'Death Row'.<br />
A Balifor watchman watches for trouble in the city.<br />

The Tavern Square<br />
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and<br />
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of<br />
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark<br />
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the<br />
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and<br />
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on<br />
the tavern wall.<br />
A small and weak looking horse is here awaiting its master.<br />

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it<br />
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits<br />
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the<br />
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and<br />
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the<br />
west is a meeting room.<br />
The Tavern owner, William Sweetwater, offers you a drink and a pie.<br />
