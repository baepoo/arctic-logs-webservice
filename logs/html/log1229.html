		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

The Avenue of the Triumvirate<br />
    Many houses of Vingaard's middle-class families stand on the north and<br />
south sides of this road as it passes east-west through the southwestern<br />
section of Vingaard. Most of the houses are made of stone, and are one to<br />
two stories tall. Short stone paths lead to the wooden front doors of the<br />
houses, with a few plants along its sides. Entrance to nearly all of the<br />
houses is prevented by gates that have been locked and barred, except to<br />
the south where the gate stands open. An array of small plants grows in the<br />
garden to the south, and the house appears to belong to a herbalist.<br />

    This cobblestone road travels east-west through the southwestern<br />
section of Vingaard. The cobblestones are about the size of your fist, and<br />
all fit together tightly. Houses of varying shapes and sizes stand along<br />
the sides of this road, most of which are stone, but some are constructed<br />
of wood. Locked gates of wrought-iron stand before the houses, preventing<br />
entry. A light smell of burning wood can be sensed in the air, most likely<br />
from the cooking or heating fires within the houses. The Avenue of the<br />
Triumvirate extends a good distance east and west.<br />

    Houses constructed of wood and stone stand on the north and south sides<br />
of this street. All of the houses are similar in their style of design, but<br />
few look the same in their size and shape. A few of the houses have small<br />
front gardens with a few plants or a tree, and most have locked gates of<br />
wrought iron that prevent entry. A light smell of burning wood can be<br />
sensed in the air, most likely from the cooking or heating fires within the<br />
houses. The Avenue of the Triumvirate stretches east and to the west, where<br />

sides of Solamnus way as it makes it way through the town to the north and<br />
south, as well as along The Avenue of the Triumvirate. A few lampposts<br />
appear occasionally along the two roads, but with no definite pattern. The<br />
town walls are visible at the end of The Avenue a distance to the west, and<br />
