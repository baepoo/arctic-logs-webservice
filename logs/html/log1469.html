		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

trail from it. The warm glow of a fire can be seen looking in the tiny door<br />

over by the frost that settles over the entire area. You can see small<br />
footprints dotting the snow. The cold wind turns your cheeks red and you<br />
find yourself constantly rubbing your hands together to try and get feeling<br />
back into them. Just a little ways to the south, you can see and smell the<br />
welcoming scent of a cook fire wafting into the crisp air. You're not sure<br />
what could be out here cooking, but the numbness of your feet says who<br />
cares.<br />

Moving Closer to the Tundra<br />

continue to make your way south towards the icy tundra. The cold wind<br />
chills you to your bones and you bring your cloak up higher to try and<br />
shake off some of the bite. You can now see a light frost blanketing the<br />
plains ahead of you, and the cold has begun to sink into your boots,<br />
numbing your toes slightly.<br />
