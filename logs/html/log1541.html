		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

The Lion and Eagle Inn<br />
    The noble animals that are this inn's namesake are reflected little in<br />
it. Though the few candles in the room provide only a very dim light, it<br />
appears the inn's common room is in very poor repair. The chairs are old<br />
and cracking, and the surface of the tables are warped. A greasy bar stands<br />
to the south with several filthy mugs resting atop its surface. A sweet yet<br />
sickening smell hangs in the air, its source unknown until you notice a<br />
half-filled bowl of 'food.'<br />

Western Perimeter Road<br />
    This neighborhood of Vingaard is inhabited by few except the peasants<br />
and the rats. The entire area contains little besides structures that are<br />
old, run down, and severely neglected due the peasants' lack of money.<br />
Although the Lords do provide adequate food for their citizens, their civic<br />
services are sorely lacking. The cobblestones beneath your feet have<br />
loosened from their once tight fit, and some have been completely knocked<br />
from the road. To the east stands a filthy building, with a sign bearing an<br />
eagle and a lion out front.<br />
A pigeon walks about pecking the ground and running from your feet.<br />
A kender skips gleefully down the street, doing his best to avoid guards.<br />
You notice a happy kender eyeing your possessions.<br />

Western Perimeter Road and Southern Perimeter Road<br />
    The two cobblestone roads of Western Perimeter and Southern Perimeter<br />
intersect here at the southwestern corner of the city. The city walls rise<br />
high above you as they extend both north and east along the outside edges<br />
of the perimeter roads. The two roads pass through predominately<br />
residential neighborhoods. Looking north, various dreary looking houses<br />
crowd the right side of the road, while to the east, the houses on the left<br />
appear to be in a slightly better condition. Pieces of trash litter the<br />
roads, and a powerful smell emanates from the filthy gutters.<br />
A crumpled piece of paper belonging in the trash lies here.<br />

Southern Perimeter Road<br />
    This section of Southern Perimeter passes through a fairly poor section<br />
of town. None of the structures that are constructed on the north side of<br />
this road are in very good condition, yet to appear to be inhabitable.<br />
Pieces of litter slowly fly around on the street as the wind pushes them<br />
along their way. The gutters along the sides of the street are fairly<br />
filthy, and a rather strong smell emanates from them. To the south,<br />
Vingaard's city wall rises above you, extending east and west.<br />
A cityguard marches down the street, keeping a vigilant eye for danger. (white aura)<br />

Solamnus Way and Southern Perimeter Road<br />
    The two roads of Solamnus and Southern Perimeter intersect here at the<br />
base of the town's large wall. The southwestern section of Vingaard appears<br />
to be residential, with mostly lower class families and individuals<br />
inhabiting the houses that appear along Southern Perimeter. The houses on<br />
Solamnus appear to be kept up a little better, and may belong to some<br />
middle-class families. A few street lamps are visible along Solamnus Way to<br />
the north, but none can be seen on Southern Perimeter as it makes its way<br />
to the east and west.<br />
A street sweeper stands here, sweeping up dirt and trash. (white aura)<br />

Southern Perimeter Road<br />
    Home to some of Vingaard's poorer residents, the structures in this<br />
area reflect the poverty of their inhabitants. Few of the buildings have<br />
been kept up very well; most appear quite old and weathered. Pieces of<br />
trash float around in the streets, congregating mostly in the gutters with<br />
other waste. Peering down the street to the east, you notice that the<br />
edifices begin to show better upkeep and generally look nicer. To the<br />
south, Vingaard's city wall rises above you, extending far to the east and<br />
west.<br />
<br />
648H 118V 8376538X 8458C Exits:EW&gt; sca<br />
Southern Perimeter Road<br />
    The peasants of Vingaard inhabit this fairly old section of the city.<br />
The structures that stand opposite the city wall to the south appear to<br />
kept up quite a bit better than those to the west. They are constructed<br />
mostly of wood and a single story, while some are stone and yet others are<br />
two stories. It seems as though the city's Lords have paid to keep up this<br />
part of the city because of its proximity to the main road through<br />
Vingaard, a bit to the east. Southern Perimeter Road extends far to the<br />
east and west.<br />
<br />
648H 117V 8376538X 8458C Exits:EW&gt; s<br />
Southern Perimeter Road<br />
    Buildings along this portion of Southern Perimeter have an odd look to<br />
them. They appear to be relatively neatly kept, clean, and structurally<br />
sound, yet have a strange quality. Looking west down the road, the<br />
structures visible look quite neglected. A quick glance at a face in the<br />
window reveals the presence of poverty. It seems as though the Lords of<br />
Vingaard have paid keep up the facades of these structures, probably due to<br />
their proximity to Southern Avenue, one of the pain roads through the town.<br />
A cityguard wanders through the town, keeping the peace. (white aura)<br />

Southern Avenue and Southern Perimeter Road<br />
    The cobblestone lanes of Southern Avenue and Southern Perimeter Road<br />
intersect here. A tall stone wall runs the length of the southern side of<br />
the street, and various houses have been constructed along the northern<br />
side. A faint smell of smoke mixed with various other aromas can be sensed<br />
in the air, apparently coming from the chimneys of the nearby houses. Far<br />
to the north, at the end of Southern Avenue, the tall gates to Vingaard's<br />
central park are visible. A large archway in the wall leads south to the<br />
gates.<br />

    This large tunnel, just behind the keep's gates, travels through the<br />
thick stone walls. The ceiling above you is curved and supported by several<br />
small arches, and two great arches stand on either end of this tunnel where<br />
they lead out into openness. The road's pavement is made of smooth, gray<br />
cobblestones about the size of your fist. Torches mounted on iron brackets<br />
provide almost all of the light for the tunnel. The air seems relatively<br />
stagnant throughout the tunnel, and mixes only with the fresh outside air<br />
at the ends. The cobblestone road heads north into the town of Vingaard,<br />
and south into the surrounding lands of grain.<br />

    Vingaard's immense iron gates stand directly to the north, where they<br />
present a significant obstacle to any attacking force, but currently they<br />
have been raised high to allow passage of people and horses. High stone<br />
walls run east and west from here, extending quite a ways before turning<br />
beyond your vision. A road heads south where it quickly turns and heads<br />
west, passing the toll station as it travels through fields of grain, and a<br />
cobblestone avenue heads north through the gates.<br />

The Tollhouse<br />
    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from<br />
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A<br />
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main<br />
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for<br />
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large<br />
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the<br />
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's<br />
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.<br />
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,<br />
