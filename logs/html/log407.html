		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

An Intersection<br />
    You have come to an intersection in the tunnels. Something seems strange<br />
about this room, but you can't seem to determine what that is. From the west<br />
you hear the sounds of snoring and occasionally the high pitched sound of<br />
metal meeting metal rings out. The southern tunnel is draped in a darkness<br />
that your torches cannot penetrate. You can hear a low, chant coming from<br />
that direction. Oddly there is a small grate set into the floor here, with<br />
no trace of any liquid having ever flowed through it.<br />

Denday says 'mud is crazy mud'<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I deleted all my characters so I guess this is where I get to say goodbye. I know it seems<br />
that I have betrayed alot of people but in my mind I just did what I had to do to kill people<br />
who tried to opress me or my close friends. I dont have enough time to waste on mud to be opressed<br />
in any way shape or form so that is just a little reason why I acted the way I did. Anyways, I realise<br />
I have caused alot of warfare and deaths of late, sorry to all who did not benefit in any way from<br />
this, would like to apologize to wild for what would seem like a betrayal, but my guys wont be<br />
used as fodder for anyone, especially Sean. Best of luck to all you fools, all my old friends from<br />
BSP, especially Charlie, Klint, the rest of the Danes, finns, the coolest evil finn around (Ddog), <br />
martin, lee, Johan,Suf, Ak,Thanos and Michi, all the russians who made the first 3/4th of this wipe so fun, you guys have always <br />
been very worthy opponents. Peace to renshai, my favorite members, Aran,Matt,Rick and Patt, best get rid of<br />
that fool Isaac before he gets you guys in more trouble. Lastly I would like to thank my immediate<br />
crew who have stuck around me for most of this wipe despite whoever I was warring, this includes<br />
Brandon, Tim, Dave,Kd, Greg, Alex, Mike, Ed, Dru, Nate(yourule), and even you Sid. Thanks also Zearin, and the<br />
group from wild, especially Will, Curtis, Chris, and Marq. I know this is becoming lengthy, so I would like<br />
to end by thanking Tripp and Dave the thief masters, for not knowing it but being my inspiration to make Krovax what he<br />
was. Sorry to any of you I forgot, Im sure there are many more to thank.<br />
If never taking crap from anyone and killing everyone that I have ever wanted to kill is a crime then<br />
I am guilty.<br />
-Raud Doom<br />
And a special thanks to Tino, for helping me quit this game, peace im out of here!
