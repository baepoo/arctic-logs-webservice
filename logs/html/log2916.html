		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

Hallway<br />
    The somber quietness blankets the hallway, the memories of the past<br />
being mourned by nature. Stone faces in the rock peer out, their mouths<br />
pulled down into maddening frowns. Stepping through the fallen ornaments,<br />
the tapestries and the furniture, a small gust of wind moves quickly down<br />
the hall; the keep sighs in pain. To the north a strange change in color<br />
can be seen in the brick wall.<br />

Hall of Festivals<br />
    Extending the full length of the room, an oversized banquet table<br />
hunches close to the stone floor. Broken dishes, goblets, and utensils<br />
cover its scarred surface, the revelers having abandoned their meal in the<br />
ancient past. As in almost a dream, slender tendrils of steam pour in from<br />
the outside, this feast hall seems to come alive for a brief moment. The<br />
music of a bard filters sweetly throughout the din of a party. Then, as<br />
suddenly as these ghostly images arrived, the steam fades away and the<br />
chaotic mess before you appears again. Smiling to yourself, memories that<br />
do not belong to you flood, overwhelm.<br />
