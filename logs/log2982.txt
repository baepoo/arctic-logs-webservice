An Old Road
Ruts formed by years of wagons travelling the road have formed sets of
straight lines running south and north. The road is straight as an
arrow,
as there is no need to detour around any obstacles. The plains of dust
extend in all directions, covered with a light layer of snow.
The corpse of a tired traveller is lying here.
a pair of beautiful sleeves lay here...it glows blue
The corpse of Qarazuz is lying here.
The corpse of Mahalembu is lying here.
The corpse of Sci is lying here.
The corpse of Stim is lying here.
The corpse of a weary traveller is lying here.
The corpse of a wandering nomad scout is lying here.
A dusty and tired traveller plods his way long the road.
