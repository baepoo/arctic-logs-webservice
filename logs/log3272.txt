After soloing a level 9 to warm up my typing skills Shino logs on and
we take on some bigger pray.

Shino flies east.
You ride your mount.
Northern Avenue
You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to
form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and
hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at
the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here.

Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern
has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there
is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south

Stone tiles mark this section of the stronghold as impressively sturdy.
The beautiful rhomboid geometry seen in each tile is distinctive of the
finest dwarven masonry. From years of use, each tile has taken on a
polished sheen to make any homeowner proud. The oak walls on the
hallway
are kept clean by a variety of custodians, and the ceiling is high with
a classic skylight window, which at the right time of day can let in a
fair share of sun.

The Halls of Outlaw
Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The
flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall
seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets
mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

Stone tiles mark this section of the stronghold as impressively sturdy.
The beautiful rhomboid geometry seen in each tile is distinctive of the
finest dwarven masonry. From years of use, each tile has taken on a
polished sheen to make any homeowner proud. The oak walls on the
hallway
are kept clean by a variety of custodians, and the ceiling is high with
a classic skylight window, which at the right time of day can let in a
fair share of sun.

The Abyss
The deathly still silence of the air is broken occasionally by a lone
tortured scream, chilling you to the bone and causing your skin to
prickle.
The emptiness around you is the purest black you have ever seen, yet it
has
no color. The empty world around you seems to shift constantly, leaving
you
dizzy and confused, wondering how you ever got here, and how you could
possibly leave. You feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand on
end,
and suddenly you feel as though someone, or something, is watching you,
waiting...
Blood flows eternally from a fountain here in the emptiness of the
Abyss.
A blackened bulletin board materializes from nothingness.
A black robed man stands here, patiently awaiting the Dark Queen's
return.
