A Trail in the Bleeding Wood
Dried, dead roots and vines snake up the old marble sides of the tower
bridge over the red Lord's River. The barren aspen forest around you
has
been home to no living elf in many lives of men, short as that may be.
The
treeless boughs poke and point into the sky and each other, while
knotted
bulges emerge from their trunks like cancer. The trees have left a
place
for one to wander, to the east.
You feel a strong wind blowing here.
