forest-like appearance. The columns cast dark shadows throughout the
cavern
and creatures above fly around in sporadic movements. A putrid odor
floats
in from the cavern to the west, and the floor seems to move as if it
were
alive. You notice that the flying creatures avoid the far west section
of
the cavern, never going too close to it.
