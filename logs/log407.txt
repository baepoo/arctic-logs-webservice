You have come to an intersection in the tunnels. Something seems
strange
about this room, but you can't seem to determine what that is. From the
west
you hear the sounds of snoring and occasionally the high pitched sound
of
metal meeting metal rings out. The southern tunnel is draped in a
darkness
that your torches cannot penetrate. You can hear a low, chant coming
from
that direction. Oddly there is a small grate set into the floor here,
with
no trace of any liquid having ever flowed through it.

The chamber of the Skull Champion is plain and undecorative, save the

wall,
polished to a delicate shine. Two black wax candles are placed on
either end of
the altar, casting two dark shadows of the knight on opposite ends of
the room.
A plain bed also adds no glamour to the room, with its bedding
undisturbed for
ages. The exit only lies towards the north.

Denday says 'mud is crazy mud'
Well I deleted all my characters so I guess this is where I get to say
goodbye. I know it seems
that I have betrayed alot of people but in my mind I just did what I
had to do to kill people
who tried to opress me or my close friends. I dont have enough time to
waste on mud to be opressed
in any way shape or form so that is just a little reason why I acted
the way I did. Anyways, I realise
I have caused alot of warfare and deaths of late, sorry to all who did
not benefit in any way from
this, would like to apologize to wild for what would seem like a
betrayal, but my guys wont be
used as fodder for anyone, especially Sean. Best of luck to all you
fools, all my old friends from
BSP, especially Charlie, Klint, the rest of the Danes, finns, the
coolest evil finn around (Ddog),
martin, lee, Johan,Suf, Ak,Thanos and Michi, all the russians who made
the first 3/4th of this wipe so fun, you guys have always
been very worthy opponents. Peace to renshai, my favorite members,
Aran,Matt,Rick and Patt, best get rid of
that fool Isaac before he gets you guys in more trouble. Lastly I would
like to thank my immediate
crew who have stuck around me for most of this wipe despite whoever I
was warring, this includes
Brandon, Tim, Dave,Kd, Greg, Alex, Mike, Ed, Dru, Nate(yourule), and
even you Sid. Thanks also Zearin, and the
group from wild, especially Will, Curtis, Chris, and Marq. I know this
is becoming lengthy, so I would like
to end by thanking Tripp and Dave the thief masters, for not knowing it
but being my inspiration to make Krovax what he
was. Sorry to any of you I forgot, Im sure there are many more to
thank.
If never taking crap from anyone and killing everyone that I have ever
wanted to kill is a crime then
I am guilty.
-Raud Doom
And a special thanks to Tino, for helping me quit this game, peace im
out of here!
