Kharzak Rips Again

POV:

Log Rating: -1.2500

Kharzak, the heavily known randomer was just asking for it resting at a
recup. Of course, I come heavily armored and still get it dead in 1
stab.

A Dry Old Road
This large road, composed mostly of dry, dusty dirt, winds its way
across the parched yellow grasses of the plains towards Delphon to the
west, and to a crossroads east of here. The wind carries with it the
sounds
of Delphon, a large city whose towering black gates glitter in both
darkness and light. Many travelers pass you by, most heading west
towards
the great city of Delphon or beginning the trek to Port Balifor which
rests
south of here, along the shores of the Khurman Sea. The breeze dies
down a
bit, replaced with the cawing of vultures overhead.
Kraz E. Man is standing here. (flying)
351H 146V 39C Exits:EW> Kraz flies in from the west.
Intersection of Alan Ak-Khan
Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are
usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down.
This
crossroads is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and
merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits
on
the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no
wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.
A small grove of trees thrives just off to the side of the road.
A wooden signpost has been hammered into the ground here.
Kraz E. Man is standing here. (flying)
(flying) Kharzak the Male High Elf is here relaxing with his head
resting against a tree.
