A Highway Through the Plains
Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and
weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire.
A poor refugee stands here, tired from his long days on the road.
A solemn knight of the sword patrols the area for draconians.
