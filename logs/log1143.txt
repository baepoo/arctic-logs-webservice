POV: Natya

Log Rating: -0.6364

Upset at the lack of logs, lack of logging, and lack of vodka intake,

The Lion and Eagle Inn
The noble animals that are this inn's namesake are reflected little in
it. Though the few candles in the room provide only a very dim light,
it
appears the inn's common room is in very poor repair. The chairs are
old
and cracking, and the surface of the tables are warped. A greasy bar
stands
to the south with several filthy mugs resting atop its surface. A sweet
yet
sickening smell hangs in the air, its source unknown until you notice a
half-filled bowl of 'food.'
Sir Rothgar Grimgaard, Solamnic Crown Knight of Maritime Delight is
standing here. (flying)
A drunk sailor sits at a table getting a bit rowdy.

North East Park
You stand in the shadow of the northern and eastern park walls. A
couple of large logs have been set up as benches, and placed up against
the
eastern wall. People have seemed to etch their initials and names into
the
walls here, staking claim to their presence at one time or another. The
chatter of chipmunks and birds fills the air and you feel a small haven
from the hurried pace of the city here.
