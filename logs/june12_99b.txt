Entrance to Level One
     This is the intersection connecting level one of the caverns to the
sloping passageway.  The passage continues to the east and west while the
entrance lies to the south.  Tall stalagmites and stalactites block
movement in other directions or make holes that are too small to fit
through. A small stream trickles by lazily headed east.

The Sloping Passage
     The passage comes steeply downward from above you, then sharply angles
itself out into a smooth floored cavern like that of above.  The spikes
still raise and fall from the ceiling and floor which make this a dream for
spelunkers. A trickle drops down from above and meanders lazily east.

A Sharp Turn Into Blackness
     Coming to the extent of the cave, the rock walls end the passage
abruptly. Spires of rock raise from the floor and in the dim lighting it
makes it difficult to see around you.  It is silent as a drop of water hits
a pool below it, then you make out the silent gurgling of the small stream
going over an edge, to fall far below.
