Carnage uses Zone Features

POV: Unknown

Log Rating: 2.7500

The end of Carnage. Carnage uses a bugged item from Pax to transfer a
Wild group from a peace room to a room in Pax which was not peace. A
few Wild died but Carnage was abyssed for their actions. Carnage then
made the decision to mass delete their characters.

Sir Aaron thanks you graciously for returning the now weakened but
still beautiful hilt. After some deliberation with Grai'lar the mage,
Aaron
determines that he can risk sneaking you into the keep now that the
artifact
has been found. After some huddled discussion between Aaron and
Grai'lar,
Aaron nods at the mage and motions for you to follow him.
After following Grai'lar to his tent, he explains to you that while he
has
been instructed to take you to the keep, he cannot reveal his method of
transportation or the path that will be taken to reach the keep. You
nod
assention and he holds his hand in the air and asks you to focus your
attention on it. After only a moment, you see the ground come rushing
towards you and suddenly all is dark.

397H 171V Mem:4 Exits:D> dA Room Inside The East Tower
The tower seems to widen a little here, you have reached a small room
with embrasures in the northern wall. A few crates are standing on the
ground. Taking a closer look you find arrows, pots with pitch and a few
flint stones. A narrow circular stairway leads up towards the top or
down to
the base of the tower. To the west you see the battlements carrying
large
iron cauldrons.
