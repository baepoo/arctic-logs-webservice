Inside a Stalagmite Column
You have ended up in a very peculiar place indeed. You seem to be in
the center of a hollowed out stalagmite column. A thin film of slime covers
the floor and uneven walls of the place. That is not what is most peculiar
about this room however: it appears that until recently, someone had taken
up residence in one side of the room. A small desk has been set up, with a
stubby little candle on it that could be used to study at. Some sort of
ceramic basin rests not far from the desk, next to a ratty looking sofa. A
small battered sign appears to have been nailed up here recently.
The corpse of Klime is lying here.
A bottle of hammered bronze has been discarded here. [2]
