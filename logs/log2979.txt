On a Coastside Road
This road follows the coast of the Khurman Sea. A glittering expanse of
blue water lies west of the road. The saline smell of saltwater hangs
thinly in the air, quickly dispelled by the frequent warm winds rolling
down from the Khuri-Khan and Ek-Khan far east of here. The cool breeze
from
the sea meets the winds of the hills here in a mild, gusty breeze that
sways the few trees that manage to grow along this road. To the north
you
see a crossroads, while south of here the road follows the sea to Port
Balifor.
A wooden sign has been hammered into the ground.

Dry, yellow, parched grasses expand all around you. Hot winds goad the
few trees that brave the heat of the relentless summer suns, and
several
travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south. The saline smell of the sea
is
slight in the air, hardly noticeable, though it is obvious that the
glittering, placid waters of the Khurman Sea are not far off. Curving
north
and west, the dusty road continues along the rolling plains.
A cloud of light flashes and blinks about the area.

Road to Port Balifor
Dry, yellow, parched grasses expand all around you. Hot winds goad the
few trees that brave the heat of the relentless summer suns, and
several
travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south. The saline smell of the sea
is
slight in the air, hardly noticeable, though it is obvious that the
glittering, placid waters of the Khurman Sea are not far off. Curving
north
and west, the dusty road continues along the rolling plains.
