Flying Citadel Isn't so Safe.

POV: Sarah

price for being a hero.

A Vast Courtyard
The cobblestoned courtyard between the portcullis and the main keep is
bumpy and rough, seemingly torn apart as the citadel was lifted from
the
ground into the air. The interior of the castle wall is smaller than it
appeared from below, with a small keep to the north and three large
towers
making up the rest of the compound. One of the towers stands directly
west,
its wall blocking movement in that direction. The middle tower rises up
from the courtyard to the northwest and the rear tower can be seen over
the
top of the keep farther north.
A long pole arm made of blackened steel sits on the ground.
A small biscuit in the shape of the bone sits here. [3]

A Sentry's Station
The entire area surrounding the citadel spreads out in a panoramic
display of the glories of Krynn. Nothing can hide from the person
holding
this vantage point. Easily seen in the courtyard below is a small open
area
just behind the blacksmith. The southern part of the citadel is visible
over the top of the main keep. All three towers are in plain view,
appearing taller from this vantage point.
A murky black disc floats here.
The corpse of a wide-eyed archer is lying here. [2]
A small wooden chest, banded with steel, occupies a corner of the
tower.

. . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.

here. (flying) (invisible)
. . . is outlined with a dim aura.

A Small Sentry Tower
From this small room, a spiral staircase winds its way upwards. A small
door leads west into a courtyard. A few benches line the back wall of
the
room and could serve as a resting spot if the citadel were attacked.
The
area above seems to be well lit, and is probably used for sentry
duties.
