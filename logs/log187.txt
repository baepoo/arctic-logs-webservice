A Highway to Caergoth
Heavily worn cobblestones lay side by side here, making for a solid
paved path that leads west towards a busy citadel. To the east the
highway
runs off towards moor grass covered plains and farmland. A stones throw
to
the south, a recently clearcut track of land appears to have been
reseeded
with small pine trees. Several detachments of Solamnic Knights patrol
this
highway protecting the steady flow of travellers and merchant caravans.

A Highway to Caergoth
Worn cobblestones pave this portion of the main throughfare to the
citadel of Caergoth, which can be seen on the western horizon. The
highway
bends towards the north and west here. While facing the north, you can
feel
the moisture saturated wind blowing in from the cape chilling your
face.

if it
wasn't for the continual flow of merchants on their way to or from
Caergoth.

You are passing through stone walls at least twenty feet thick. The
stones above you look worn by the winds of ages gone by. A heavy iron
portcullis is raised against the walls here, ready to be lowered to bar
passage from this end of the tunnel. The salty air coming from the east
end
of the tunnel smells of freshly milled lumber. To the west the tunnel
leads
into the city.
