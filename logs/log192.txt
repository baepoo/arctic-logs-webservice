The death cry of Ghetti echoes from somewhere nearby...
289H 89V 837C Mem:7 Exits:NESW> take all ghetti
It's a pretty ghastly sight! Searching through the remains, you find:
corpse (here) :
a runed sickle..it hums softly
an apatite encrusted bracelet..it glows dimly
the dark brown ceremonial robes
a pair of leather sleeves
a pair of white cloth gloves
a pair of ivory anklets
a long flowing black cowl
a furry white cloak
a long black stole, lined with red
a shark tooth necklace
a ring of spell turning..it glows dimly [2]
a red dragonscale book
a large pile of coins
a mithril ranseur
a glowing scroll of recall..it glows dimly
a stick of incense
a small wooden chest
a small canteen
after...
Quintley tells you 'fuck why the hell didnt winds work'
