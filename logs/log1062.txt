This is Vingaard Avenue, a well traveled street that runs north-south
through Kalaman. To the north, you see the busy town square and bazaar.

general populace. The Traveler's Lodge is to the west and a fine diner
is
to the east.

entrance is quite large and open; you get a feeling you will enjoy your
stay here already.
A Knight of Solamnia walks about the inn, keeping it safe.
