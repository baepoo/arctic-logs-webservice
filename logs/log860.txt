A Road through Port o'Call
Continuing on your way through the small, portside city of Port o'Call,
you can see what looks like the center of the town to the south. You
can
hear the loud shouts of vendors selling their wares to all the
passersby. A

strong smell of fish and the sea can be smelled on the air as it floats
past you on its way inland.
