The Halls of Vengeful Ambition
Hanging from the center of a gold crown molded ceiling is a large
chandelier burning a beautiful red flame. The flame is the result of
the
burning of sodium and some other select chemical compounds, secret to
the
pyromancers of Deep Mine. A servant seems to be dusting the ceiling and
walls on a small step stool. This job must need to be done with some
regularity, as the adventurers who frequent this stronghold track in
copious amounts of debris.
A clan bulletin board is mounted on the wall here.

Ambition
Stone tiles mark this section of the stronghold as impressively sturdy.
The beautiful rhomboid geometry seen in each tile is distinctive of the
finest dwarven masonry. From years of use, each tile has taken on a
polished sheen to make any homeowner proud. The oak walls on the
hallway
are kept clean by a variety of custodians, and the ceiling is high with
a classic skylight window, which at the right time of day can let in a
fair share of sun.
A faint blue aura radiates from the walls.
