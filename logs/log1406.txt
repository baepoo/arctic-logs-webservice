Lost in the Shrine of Light
As if the lower level of the Shrine wasn't bright enough, the light
seems redoubled here in its effort to blind you. Eyes clenched almost
closed reflexively from the painful brightness, you see no difference
in
the rooms ... solid, yellow gold is everywhere, sucking in your
reflection
and twisting it, refracting it, multiplying it to infinity and sending
it
bouncing around the room in a gross distortion of the original. Finely
etched runes can be seen on the ceiling and floor, but the light makes
them
almost impossible to decipher.
