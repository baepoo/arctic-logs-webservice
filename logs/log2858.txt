Near the Vingaard River
Passing through the Solamnic Plain, the soft gurgle of the Vingaard can

small
grove of trees can be seen, standing lonely in the flat grasslands of
the
plain. A gentle breeze blows, tossing the grasses back and forth,
carrying
a slightly sweet smell with it. The road extends south toward Solanthus
and
the Newsea, and northward toward Vingaard.

Travelling The Plains
The plains get vaster as you delve deeper into them. Though mostly
composed of weed, an occasional farmer can be seen tilling the land and
nurturing his crops. Off in the distance, towards the east, thick
columns
of smoke rise into the air, giving signs of a recent battle. The road
is
hard and well-travelled. To the east you hear the sound of running
water,
of a fast flowing river.

A Highway Through the Plains
Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches to the north and to the south, escaping the horizon. Quiet
and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and
weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire. A small
path branches off to the east here, and at the crossroad a small sign
is
posted to a brown stake.
