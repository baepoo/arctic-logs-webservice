A Highway Through the Plains
Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and
weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire.

Entrance to the Dark woods
The wide and packed road that led through the southern part of Solamnia
suddenly plunges into a dark forest. While the forest appears to be
rather
healthy, a great sense of evil emanates from it. The trees, tall and
straight, seem to snicker as you enter the vile forest known today as
the
Darkwoods. Unlike the road through the plains, the road here seems less
travelled. There is sudden movement all around and the howls of a
strange
beast can be heard.

black forest, twisting like a small snake. Overhead, the dark and
twisted
trees loom, towering above you like silent guardians. Off in the
distance,
several howls and strange screams can be heard, most of them coming
from
the forest. Strangely, the road seems less travelled these days, almost
as
if people are afraid to venture out of the cities. Several branches and
cut-down trees lie in the road here and there, making travel hard.
