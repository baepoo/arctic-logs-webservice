*The thing standing in front of you is a strange creature indeed.
*A faint wind catches one of its black robes, showing parts of its
body.
*Several areas of flesh and skin is missing, and most of its body seems
to be decaying.
*Skin, flesh and intrails (I think he means entrails) are all green,
brown and black, not pink and red as you would expect.
*It coughs loudly, spraying blood from its mouth.
*You think to yourself, that some powerful force must be keeping this
creature alive.. but.. Why?
