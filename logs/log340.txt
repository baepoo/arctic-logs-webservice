Trail through the Island
You are surrounded by tall, swaying grasses and rolling foothills. The
wind rhythmically makes the grasses sway back and forth, almost putting
you
into a trance. However, the mood is perversed by knowing that something
just isn't right. You aren't able to deduce what makes you aware of
this,
but the fact of the matter is, something's wrong.
