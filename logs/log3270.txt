Nearing the City of Vingaard
The road here passes through some large fields of grain, a sign that a
large city is nearby. Looking westward, the towers of Vingaard Keep are
visible perched atop a hill with the city's walls nearby. The road
continues north to a junction of roads from other parts of the
continent
and a small tollhouse that stands watch over the intersection. To the
south, the road crosses the Vingaard River via a ford in the river.

The West Bank
The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to
control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area
due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies
have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking
to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through
the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

The Knights' High Road ends here, just west of the city of Vingaard.
The city's massive town wall surrounds the city just to the northeast,
while perched atop a hill to the southeast is the main keep, and
impressive
fortification. Large swatches of fertile farmlands surround the town,
and a
small road leads off to the north through them. Directly to the east is

from

The Knights' High Road
You travel along a very long road, extending as far as you can see
through the seemingly endless Solamnic Plain. The road is wide and
obviously heavily used, though some tracks seem a bit old. The
occasional
bird flies high overhead, quietly cruising around searching for prey. A
light breeze blows, carrying the sweet smell of the plains with it. The
road extends west-northwest toward Palanthas and east-southeast to
Vingaard, its keep perched atop a hill barely visible on the horizon.

The Tollhouse
This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
The corpse of Abom is lying here.
The corpse of Oo is lying here.
The corpse of Laxus is lying here.
A steel breastplate inscribed with crowns is lying here.
A loaf of bread has been left here. [5]
A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.
A mercury golem, Cholo, stands here, its body incessantly flowing.
. . . is entangled in a mass of thorny vines.
