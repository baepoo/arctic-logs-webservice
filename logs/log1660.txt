A Small Clearing in the Park
This is an open area in the park. All the small paths converge here in
front of the entrance to a small shrine. The shrine is dedicated to
nature
and the life it supports. There is a small archway leading into the
shrine.
A white marble fountain spring is in the middle of the clearing.
A tiny, shimmering faerie hovers near you.
Kallisto the Male Gnome is standing here.
A large pigeon is here pecking at some bread crumbs.
