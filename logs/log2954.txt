Pebble Creek Street
The strange street, composed of pebbles, only accentuates the natural
beauty of the city. The path is quite colorful, and the stones are
quite
unlike any you have found on Ansalon. Looking closer, you notice that
the
pebbles have been arranged to make a design in the street: a small
creek,
with abundant wildlife. It moves further into the city and weaves its
way
between the houses.

Solace School of Magic
You are surrounded by what appears to be a combination of a library and
classroom. The eastern wall contains a small wooden door, but the
remainder
of the wall is covered with shelves of books. All the books appear to
be
well maintained, despite some appearing to be quite old. Students of
magic
in robes of red, white and black sit in rows practicing their art.
Small
bolts of lightning dance around the tables, obviously part of the
lessons
for today.
A magical sign floats in the air here...it glows blue..it glows dimly
A chart of the moons is posted on the wall over in the far corner.

A beautiful vallenwood leaf falls to the ground.

The narrow bough comes to an end here. The new school of magic lies to
the west, while strange chanting can be heard from the north. A hut
built
from sewn patches of animal skins stretched across the vallenwood
branches
lie to the east. A small grove can be seen at the base of the tree, as
a
small branch slopes gently down from here providing passage. Finally,
the
bough moves back toward the trunk to the south.

the west, while strange chanting can be heard from the north. A hut

lie to the east. A small grove can be seen at the base of the tree, as
a
small branch slopes gently down from here providing passage. Finally,
the
bough moves back toward the trunk to the south.

The Halls of Beast Clan
Along the eastern wall of this area is a rather expensive looking
polished
red granite counter. Its origins are mysterious, but one might guess it
to
be from some of the quarries in the Khalkist Mountains. Behind the
counter
sits a sharp looking mechanical accountant. It has been colored a
pleasant
aqua green to emphasize the stoney red of the counter. Clearly,
deposits
to and withdrawals from the hearty safe should be taken up with the
automaton.

Large paintings are almost covering the whole white brick wall and

them.

Dew drops, pine cones, bat guano, and snake tongues are among the
numerous
alchemical components held on racks and shelves throughout this small
shop
in the stronghold. In the center of the room a cauldron bubbles forth a
sickly sweet smell from some yellowish green liquid. Most definitely,
this
is a good place for an aspiring alchemist to gain the tools necessary
to
become more achieved in his or her craft, and if that is not the goal,
peeking at all the interesting curios in the shop offers plenty of
distraction.
