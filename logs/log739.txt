Near the Virkhus Hills
The road continues from here, traveling to the north and south. The
vast Solamnic Plain stretches out into the eastern horizon, while the
Virkhus hills lie to the west and north. Tall grasses along side sway
gently in the wind. The Knights' High Road, the main link between
Vingaard
to the east and Palanthas to the west, extends eastward far beyond your
vision. The road is wide and obviously heavily traveled, though traffic
seems to be dwindling as reports of war gain credibility.
