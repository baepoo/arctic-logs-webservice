Gerte loses the Maza Way

POV:

Log Rating: 4.0000

Gerte Falls From Grace.

269H 0V 25306579X 108C Exits:NE>
Gerte flies in from the east.
Thunder sounds as a streak of blue lightning arches to the ground.
269H 0V 25306579X 108C Exits:NE>
Gerte begins resting but stays aloft.
269H 0V 25306579X 108C Exits:NE>
Thunder sounds as a streak of blue lightning arches to the ground.
269H 0V 25306579X 108C Exits:NE> say haha
You say 'haha'
269H 0V 25306579X 108C Exits:NE>
Gerte rolls his eyes.
269H 0V 25306579X 108C Exits:NE> say i WIN!
You say 'i WIN!'
269H 0V 25306579X 108C Exits:NE> rem staff
You stop using a staff of the abyss.
269H 0V 25306579X 108C Exits:NE>
Gerte closes his spellbook with a content look on his face.
You board the Cloudmaster just as it is taking off.
On the Deck of the Cloudmaster
Flying at breakneck speed several miles straight up you have a
wonderful
view of Krynn for miles around. The rushing wind is strong on deck, but
taking a firm grip of the railing and leaning into it, you find it
tolerable. As you peer down at the country-side, you can see a small
village
with houses and even chimney smoke! Already you can see the glittering
waters of Newsea on the horizon.
Gerte Bros, Head of the Order of the Red Robes is resting here.
(flying) (invis
ible)
. . . is surrounded by 4 duplicate images.
271H 22V 25306579X 108C > hit gerte
The ground seems like a clay model below you...you gaze in wonder.
Columns of Blue and White
Great pillars of vapor hang like sentinels all around you, fat columns
of blue and white that look as solid as marble in the moons' light.
Studying the clouds through a gnomish eyeglass, you still see nothing
but
their sculpted surfaces, as smooth and still as a frozen pond.
Gerte steps to the side of the Cloudmaster and peers over the edge.
271H 22V 25306579X 108C >
Gerte heads for the hatch to escape the freezing cold.
As you fly through the clouds, it begins to get very icy, you head for
the hatch that leads below.
Inside the Cloudmaster
You are forced to stay inside the Cloudmaster as you pass through the
deepest parts of space. The threat of being sucked off the deck is just
too
great. Here on the inside there are many marvels to behold. An oaken
table
with brass legs is nailed to the floor, like most items here are. A
large
machine takes up most of the room, many knobs, pullies, levers, and
handles
jut from the innards of the beast. You couldn't possibly imagine what
it
could do. A small hatch leads up onto the deck.
Gerte Bros, Head of the Order of the Red Robes is resting here.
(flying) (invis
ible)
. . . is surrounded by 4 duplicate images.
Wingover, the Navigator of the Lunitari Exploration Crew, is standing
here.

You miss Gerte with your hit.
You step out onto the hull of the Cloudmaster, now that it is safe.
To the Red Moon
Lunitari is growing visibly larger with each passing hour. From a
featureless red globe, it has developed dark red mountain peaks, purple
valleys, and wide scarlet plains. Stutts and Wingover were debating
ceaselessly as to why the moon was so dominated by red hues. As usual,
they resolved nothing.
Gerte steps outside the hull, now that it is safe.
53H 66V 25306579X 108C Mem:6> say YOU HAVE LOST THE MAZA WAY
Gerte plummets to the ground below...
The red glowing orb of Lunitari looms in the distance.
Above Lunitari
There is nothing in view now but Lunitari. Though Wingover didn't
change course, the horizon seemed to sink from overhead to bows-on. As
the
minutes speed by, the red landscape is spreading out to every horizon.
Gerte Bros, Head of the Order of the Red Robes is standing here.

You plummet to the ground below...
Nearing a Crash Landing
The tableland is giving way to a featureless plain. The dark red soil
smooth and unrippled. At least Paladine has favored you with an
uncluttered place to land the flying ship!
Gerte falls from above.
53H 66V 25306579X 108C Mem:6>
Gerte braces for the impact of the ship clashing with the moon.
You brace for impact of the impending crash.
Lunitari Exploratory Headquarters, Mark I
Lunitari is flat all the way to the horizon. You now stand on hard,
red tinged rocks. It looks as if you are on the shore of a large ocean,
a
large expanse of smooth and unrippled red soil stretches out before
you.
Gerte Bros, Head of the Order of the Red Robes is standing here.

. . . is surrounded by 4 duplicate images.
A lost tree wanders around aimlessly here.
