Valkur raises his dagger high into the air and strikes at you!
The dagger comes to life, freezing you where you stand with utter terror!
It sings through the air towards your chest, craving your heart.
You cannot move as the dagger strikes your chest with a sickening thud.
You can hear your ribs crunch and break under the weapons awesom power,
You feel a horrid ripping sensation and scream in uncontrollable agony!
The dagger wrenches free of you, your still-beating heart in it's spidery grasp.
Blackness falls over you, and you fall to the ground. You can literally
Feel your lifeforce flow into Valkur, sacrifised to her majesty Lloth...
Valkur raises his hand, and calls down the might of the Forgers upon you!
Valkur slowly devours your soul as it rises out of your dead body.
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! The pain is agonizing, though there is no escape..
Your soul is destroyed utterly, forever obliterated from this world...
