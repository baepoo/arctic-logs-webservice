Inside the Grand Gates of Sanction
A feeling of dread overwhelms you as you stand back and look over the
interior of Sanction. This is a huge fortress city veiled in eternal
darkness. You see a large tower, to the northwest corner while a large
sinister looking palace sits in the northeast corner. A huge temple
devoted
to the Dark Queen is located south. A set of barred gates to the west
closes off Sanction from the outside.
