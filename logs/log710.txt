On the Edge of a Mighty Rift
The mighty crystal gates of the vry-kith village lie to the north, and
you can see the tall mantis warriors walking the walls above you. They
stare at you warily and with mirth as you seek to proceed south towards
the
huge spanse of the rift. The village seems almost to teeter on the edge
of
the chasm, always hanging on the edge of existence almost. The darkness
of
the rift lies below you, swallowing all the light around you. The gates
of
the city look very inviting to the north, while the cold winds seem
almost
to be blowing you down into the rift. Darkness awaits you below.

The Icewind Gate
The stark guardians of this village eye you warily as you pass by. The
enigmatic gazes of the mantis warriors fill you with doubts and self-
apprehension. The southern gate looks weathered and beaten, as if the
forces of nature herself seek to penetrate this village. There are
definitely more warriors in this part of the village, and the dangers
of
the barren ice reveal few secrets.

The mighty crystal gates of the vry-kith village lie to the north, and
you can see the tall mantis warriors walking the walls above you. They
stare at you warily and with mirth as you seek to proceed south towards
the
huge spanse of the rift. The village seems almost to teeter on the edge
of
the chasm, always hanging on the edge of existence almost. The darkness
of
the rift lies below you, swallowing all the light around you. The gates
of
the city look very inviting to the north, while the cold winds seem
almost
to be blowing you down into the rift. Darkness awaits you below.

The Icewind Gate
The stark guardians of this village eye you warily as you pass by. The
enigmatic gazes of the mantis warriors fill you with doubts and self-
apprehension. The southern gate looks weathered and beaten, as if the
forces of nature herself seek to penetrate this village. There are
definitely more warriors in this part of the village, and the dangers
of
the barren ice reveal few secrets.
