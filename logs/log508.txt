You flee head over heels.
By a Small Hovel
Wearily, you come to stop outside a small hovel. It looks like it has
been built as a rest stop to provide a safe haven for travellers. The
hovel
sits off to the west of the main road here. The road itself stretches
out
to the north and east. The terrain to the east is becomes dry and
dusty,
while you can see what appears to be a forest on the edge of the plains
to
the north.
A traveling mercenary is here, seeking employment.

A Small Hovel
This is the interior of a small hovel. There are a few crude bunks and
a small table. A firepit is in the center of the hovel, presumably used
for
cooking. Wooden shutters cover the small windows and there is a small
bar
used to lock the door to the hovel. These appear to be the only
precautions
taken against highway robbers and other assorted bandits. The small
door
exits to the east.
A large torch lies here.
A bright pile of cloth lies on the ground.
You see the outline of a life form here, carrying: an enchanted rat
bone charm; a pair of finely
crafted circlets.
