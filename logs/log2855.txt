The Entrance to the Halls of CORE
This short corridor running through the stronghold looks rather simple.
Large paintings are almost covering the whole white brick wall and
several
plants that sit on small dark stone pedestals are placed here and there
all over the hallway. A couple of hardwood benches are roughly shoved
into
one of the corners and a few matching tables are standing in front of
them.

Stone tiles mark this section of the stronghold as impressively sturdy.
The beautiful rhomboid geometry seen in each tile is distinctive of the
finest dwarven masonry. From years of use, each tile has taken on a
polished sheen to make any homeowner proud. The oak walls on the
hallway
are kept clean by a variety of custodians, and the ceiling is high with
a classic skylight window, which at the right time of day can let in a
fair share of sun.

The Halls of CORE
Hanging from the center of a gold crown molded ceiling is a large
chandelier burning a beautiful red flame. The flame is the result of
the
burning of sodium and some other select chemical compounds, secret to
the
pyromancers of Deep Mine. A servant seems to be dusting the ceiling and
walls on a small step stool. This job must need to be done with some
regularity, as the adventurers who frequent this stronghold track in
copious amounts of debris.

Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The
flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall
seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets
mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

The Knights' High Road
Stretching out from horizon to horizon, the Knights' High Road passes
through the Solamnic Plain, connecting the city of Vingaard with the
lord
city of Palanthas. The shining jewel of Solamnia, Palanthas lies far to
the
west and north, beyond Westgate Pass in the Vingaard Mountains, while
the
city of Vingaard lies east-south-east of here. The tall grasses of the
plains seem to go on forever, gently swaying back and forth with the
breeze. Barely visible far to the west are a few mountain peaks.
A wooden sign has been hammered into the ground.

You are overwhelmed with awe as you enter the Hall of Forgotten Heroes.
Before you stands a double row of statues, each one a monument and
memory
to the greatest members of your Clan from days gone by. At one end of
the
room stands a small altar, with dedications to all the Gods of Krynn,
testament to diversity of faith of the members of your Clan. At the
other
end of the room is a check in desk, and stairs leading up to rooms in
the
stronghold. A wizened man sits patiently at the desk, waiting for Clan
members to return for rest and recuperation, and perhaps share a tale
of
their latest adventure.

A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the

variety of curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings,
lizard

strangely colored liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears.

Ringing, from hammer on anvil, and hissing, from quenching of heated
metal, fills the ears upon entering this lively and active smithy. A
steady repairing of all the weapons, armor, and artifacts brought to
the
smithy fills the day for most of the workers here. A small contingent,
though, appears to be dedicated to making both kitchenware and
horseshoes.
Certainly, if something needed repairing this would be an appropriate
place to have the work done.

The Clan vault is certainly impressive. Row upon row of neatly arranged
armour, weapons, necklaces, rings, and any other item that might be
potentially useful in further clan adventures. There are no traces of
dust.
Every single item has been repaired and cleaned until it shines. In the
middle of the room stands a large desk. A large tome lays open on the
desk.
A closer look at the tome displays several columns of figures, dates,
item

his
moustache. He glances up from entering figures in the tome and beckons
you to
take a seat opposite him. You can't help but feel a little nervous

Hanging from the center of a gold crown molded ceiling is a large

burning of sodium and some other select chemical compounds, secret to

regularity, as the adventurers who frequent this stronghold track in
copious amounts of debris.

A Road Through the Vingaard Mountains
This well traveled road gently winds its way up the Vingaard Mountains,
hugging the edges of the mountainsides. The area is fairly rocky, but
there
are some small patches of trees here and there, a bit of snow still
hanging
on their branches. A few hearty birds remain despite the cold, their
song
clear in the crisp air. The road begins to climb a bit more rapidly as
it
heads northward, while it gently slopes down to the east.

Near Westgate Pass
Directly to the north, the High Clerist Tower rises skyward, reaching
higher than any other structure on Krynn. The tower, an ancient bastion
of
the Solamnic Knighthood, stands just to the side of Westgate pass. The
Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies
beyond. A few snow-capped peaks of the Vingaard Mountains can be seen
in
the distance, their impressive heights dwarfed by the massive tower. To
the
south, the road leads back down to the plains through the mountains.

The Southern Portcullis
A large portcullis to the north bodes fair warning to those that would
attempt to storm the tower. Beyond the portcullis lies the pride of the
Solamnic Knighthood, the High Clerist Tower. The tower represents a
shining
example for the citizens across all Krynn, and legend has it that while
the
faithful stand on the walls, the tower shall not fall. Eastwards lies a
small path around the tower walls.

Along the Walls of the High Clerist Tower
The pathway around the tower walls is quite narrow, allowing very
little movement. This path appears to have been much wider at one
point,
but additions to the tower walls have brought it down to just a few
feet
wide. Small stones fall from the mountain side above, striking the
ground
constantly. Several small cracks are visible in the tower wall here,
indicating a possible weakness in the towers defenses.

and
towering height, stands here, providing an excellent addition to the
already
massive tower walls. Small stones rain down from the mountain side, a

the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
grasses

manure. Around you grass is blown in the wind, growing thicker as it

boulder

heading

Before an Old Cemetery
To the north stands a rusty bronze gate, hanging slightly off its
hinges. Stretching to either side of it stands an old rickety fence
surrounding what appears to be a graveyard. To the east the trail leads
to
the western city gates of Kalaman, to the west it leads deeper into the
fields, and toward the river.
A pile of leathery copper material lies here.
A hulking, gray gargoyle, Broadway, is perched here like a statue.
Golbez the Male Human is standing here. (flying)
. . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.
A tiny, shimmering faerie hovers near you.
Caezar the Male Goblin is standing here. (flying)
