507H 166V 3811982X 107C Exits:NESWU> eEastern Avenue
The road is cut from among the huge vallenwoods which protect and house
the inhabitants of Solace. The limbs overhead entwine with one another
to
provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the
sun,
while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large
vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you
notice a
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway
spirals
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the
temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west
towards
Solace Square.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly
A janitor is walking around, cleaning up.
A citizen of Solace moves quickly about.

Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
huge
vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some
sorts.
A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
the
thick limbs which house the guild hall.
A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.
