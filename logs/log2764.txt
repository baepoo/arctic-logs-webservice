The Inn of the Last Home
The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace
dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill
the
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another
stairway
leads down to the forest below.

You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the
clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the
tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue
to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching
the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the
stairway.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here.
