Welcome to the land of Krynn.
The Reception
This is the reception of the lodge, where you would sign in for a
room. This is also a very popular place where adventurers sit around
and
share tales of their journeys. Some stairs in the back lead up to the
quarters.
A wooden bulletin board with the heading 'Wanted' is posted on the
wall.

Traveler's Lodge
The lodge is famous for its hospitality and friendly service. The
lodge also has its own cafe, where they make great tasting coffee.
There is
also a lounge for the guests to rest and relax or do some reading. The
entrance is quite large and open; you get a feeling you will enjoy your
stay here already.
A Knight of Solamnia walks about the inn, keeping it safe.

Cutting Across the Balifor Steppes
With the hustle and bustle of Balifor to your west, you find yourself
at the edge of the desert plains. The road beneath your feet is nothing
more than packed dirt, created over the years by the thousands of
travellers that have walked this path before you. Sparse vegetation and
a
lack of trees make your journey a rather mundane one. A faint breeze
rustles the high grass around the road and ruffles your hair.

A Branch Off the Main Road
An intersection is due west, where a large highway leads into the
bustling port city of Port Balifor just to the south and on to the west
through the lands of Khur. The road leads also east, becoming more of a
path, through the Balifor Steppes towards the eastern lands of Ansalon.

The Road To Port Balifor
This long and dusty road leads south to the port of Balifor, a busy
trading centre for Krynn. All travellers are welcome in Port Balifor
but
one must remain wary of the constant flow of smugglers and thieves that
call this town home. Known for its bawdy taverns, black markets and
expansive slums, Balifor is not home for the meek.

You follow Ishvadsu north.
Road to Port Balifor
Dry, yellow, parched grasses expand all around you. Hot winds goad the
few trees that brave the heat of the relentless summer suns, and
several
travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south. The saline smell of the sea
is
slight in the air, hardly noticeable, though it is obvious that the
glittering, placid waters of the Khurman Sea are not far off. Curving
north
and west, the dusty road continues along the rolling plains.
