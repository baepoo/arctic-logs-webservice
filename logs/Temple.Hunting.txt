We claired Ahma to find they were doing Temple of Takhisis.  Knowing the only way out was to
recall, we staked out Pal inn while Pahuta relo'd and attempted to prism them out.  They didn't
recall, so we went to hunt them in the temple.  We were using mostly trash chars due to high risk
in Pal.

protection which Takhisis provides! We are protected even from the
