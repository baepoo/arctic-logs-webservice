Pushing cobwebs aside, you peer through the darkness of this abandonned
section of tunnel. You can make out the sharp marks of picks along the
walls,
showing where the dwarves have done their mining. A thick layer of dust
covers the walls now, and you cause dust to rise from the cavern floor
as you
step. It is obvious that no one has been down this passage for some
time, but
why did the dwarves abandon it?

Dwarves pass you on either side, some carrying large sacks of rocks and
ore, others wheeling small carts in and out of the cave. Strong, stout
dwarves swing steel picks high over their heads and crash them down
into the
rocks of the mountain in rhythmic movements, making the sound almost
like a
gnome machine. The dwarves pay you no heed and continue to work at the
task
before them. This open tunnel continue its way to the north where you
can
hear more of the dwarves working. To the south, you can hear someone
shouting
over the dull throng of clinks and clanks.
