   Crossing the Newsea
   Harsh waves sends spouts of mist into the air as you cross the Newsea
   The weather is harsh and the sky is a gloomy gray. It is very hard to
   navigate though the turbulent waters large waves and strong waves seem
   to
   cover most of this sea. The waters here seem unnaturally dark and you
   see
   few signs of life. The Newsea, created during the Cataclysm, now
   separates
   Solamnia and Abanasinia.

   Bordering the Shore
   The road you have been following is now running so close to the shore
   that you can almost feel the waves lapping at your feet. You can't help
   but
   wonder if when the tides come in the road will be covered. Maybe the
   tides
   are the reason for the large number or stones that can be seen to the
   east.

   Nearing Hamilton
   From this road, that is running near the shoreline, one can see several
   small fishing boats anchored in the shallows, with their nets thrown
   overboard. You can only assume these boats belong to those that live in
   the
   small village to the west.

   Outside Hamilton
   Directly to your south, a road enters the settlement of Hamilton. Based
   on its location along the northern shore of the Straits of Schallsea,
   you
   can only assume that the economy of this village revolves around the
   fish
   that are harvested daily. Most of the buildings look quiet shabby, so
   unless this is your destination, you will probably want to just
   continue
   down the road.

   Nearing Hamilton
   A short distance to the south, you can see several men casting nets
   over the sides of their fishing vessels. Assuming the village of
   Hamilton
   is just a short distance to the east, you figure the majority of those
   sailors reside there.

   Across Dry Ground
   The road continues from here to the east and to the west, where it can
   be seen crossing the grass plains of Southlund. You can feel some
   moisture
   in the air, that you assume is a result of the Straits of Schallsea
   being
   just a few miles south.

   Across Dry Ground
   Comparing this portion of the road, to the swampy area you can make out
   to the south, you are not sure why anyone would want to leave this dry
   ground. The road also continues towards the east, where it can be seen
   crossing the plains of short grass, that also spread north to the farm
   lands of Southlund and Solamnia.

   Passing through a Bog
   Small puddles of stagnant, algae covered mud dot the path here, making
   movement risky. The stench of decaying animal and plant life, mixed
   with
   the smell of mildew encrusted mud makes this a place you probably don't
   want to be. As you look around yourself, you can't help but wonder why
   whoever blazed this path didn't guide it around this bog.
