   Outside a Small Thatched Hut
   Some of the cold has abided some, leaving you with a warm feeling
   coming from a small hut to the east. The thatched roof of the hut has a
   large chimney made of hardened mud protruding from it, and wifts of
   smoke
   trail from it. The warm glow of a fire can be seen looking in the tiny
   door
   to the hut and you feel almost compelled to go in and warm yourself.

   A Frost Covered Trail
   Most of what was left of the trail you were following has been covered
   over by the frost that settles over the entire area. You can see small
   footprints dotting the snow. The cold wind turns your cheeks red and
   you
   find yourself constantly rubbing your hands together to try and get
   feeling
   back into them. Just a little ways to the south, you can see and smell
   the
   welcoming scent of a cook fire wafting into the crisp air. You're not
   sure
   what could be out here cooking, but the numbness of your feet says who
   cares.

   Moving Closer to the Tundra
   Despite all the efforts of nature to ward you from this place, you
   continue to make your way south towards the icy tundra. The cold wind
   chills you to your bones and you bring your cloak up higher to try and
   shake off some of the bite. You can now see a light frost blanketing
   the
   plains ahead of you, and the cold has begun to sink into your boots,
   numbing your toes slightly.
