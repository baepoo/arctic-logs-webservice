   Nearing the City of Vingaard
   The road here passes through some large fields of grain, a sign that a
   large city is nearby. Looking westward, the towers of Vingaard Keep are
   visible perched atop a hill with the city's walls nearby. The road
   continues north to a junction of roads from other parts of the
   continent
   and a small tollhouse that stands watch over the intersection. To the
   south, the road crosses the Vingaard River via a ford in the river.

   Dra flies in from the south.
   The Tollhouse
   This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
   Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
   A
   road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
   main
   keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
   for
   those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
   table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
   wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
   coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
   Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
   Palanthas,
   north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
   The corpse of Sedai is lying here.
   A sheaf of spellbook pages has been left here.
   Something metallic has been dropped on the ground.
   A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.
