   Similar to many of the other corridors in this place, the lack of any
   light sources makes this area very dark. The darkness is further
   increased
   by the large, charcoal-black scorch marks that cover much of the walls,
   floor, and ceiling. Splotches of dark crimson dot the hard rock floor,
   probably the result of a scuffle that may have taken place here. The
