   A Dusty Road
   Directly to the south the massive stone walls of a fort tower
   above the flat plains. Archers can be seen pacing the tops of the
   walls, keeping a vigilant watch. The road leads closer to the fort
   southward and makes a turn to the west.

   Before the Gates
   Thick, black iron-barred gates are hung off the immense walls of
   the fort, which seem to rise into the heavens. Through the gates it
   is possible to see into the busy courtyard, although what exactly is
   happening is a mystery. To the north a road leads away from the fort
   into the plains.
   514H 100V 6984220X 11C Exits:N(S)> The gates seems to be closed.

   You pull on the gates, but they seem to be stuck. With a little more
   effort, you try again. The gates swing open with a loud creek.

   Within the Gates
   To the north are the large barred gates of the fort, through
   which can be seen the brown grasses of the plains. To the south the
   courtyard opens up into the heart of the fort, which is constantly
   full of recruits and their trainers. Large iron doors are on the east
   and west walls with signs posted on each.

   In the Courtyard
   Surrounding the courtyard is a huge wall made of black granite
   blocks with many archers patrolling the top, scanning for trouble.
   The courtyard itself is crowded with people, recruits and trainers
   march around and practice skills in every corner. To the north the
   entrance gates can be seen.
   A trainer wanders the courtyard screaming at recruits. (white aura)

   A trainer twirls his baton as he leaves east.

   Your detect invisibility wears off.
