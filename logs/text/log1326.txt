   An Old and Worn Road
   The land to the east begins to rise into the foothills of the Eastwall
   mountains. An old and worn road runs west through the plains of
   Abanasinia
   and turns east here to run alongside the foothills. The Eastwall
   mountain
   range extends out to the northeast from here, the road appears to run
   alongside the foothills for some distance. The plains extend out for a
   few
   leagues to the west where they end at the base of another mountain
   range,
   the Kharolis mountains.
   Halgren the Male Hylar Dwarf is resting here. (flying) (invisible)

   The guild is full of adventurers of all types, who are trying to hone
   and perfect their skills. The walls are covered with racks of weapons
   and
   armour that are used in the training. Huge book cases also fill the
   room,
   containing numerous spell books and scrolls. There are even chests and
   doors that seem to be made specifically for practice by thieves and
   their
   lockpicks. One master of all skills oversees all the training and
   progression here. A small stairway leads down out of the tree and to
   the
   ground below. A hall leads north. The Hall of Justice is to the south.
   Halgren the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
   The guild guard stands here guarding the adventurer's guild.
