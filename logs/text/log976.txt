   Shorne RIP

   POV: Vinoa

   Log Rating: 2.6667

   We calmly are walking through the Caergothian Highway when we are
   ambushed!

   619H 133V 7803019X 488C Exits:ESW> You kneel down and study the ground.
   You can't seem to find any tracks.
   A shiny black stallion arrives from the east.
   Crossing the Plains
   Winding its way across the windy and fertile Solamnic plains, the
   highway stretches far to the north and to the east. Merchants slowly
   make
   their way across the plains supplying the cities of Solamnia with goods
   from the other corners of the world. Endless plains surround the
   highway,
   almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds. The
   loud
   sound of the New Sea's waves crashing against the land can be heard far
   to
   the south, where several gulls can barely be seen.
   A shiny black stallion shakes its white starred head at you. (white
   aura)
   Shorne the Male Kender is standing here. (flying)
