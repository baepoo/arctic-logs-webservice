   The Turning Point of the War

   POV: Gloucester

   Log Rating: 0.7273

   The group achieves its battle objectives and recovers the most
   essential battle item: an enchanted barrel. Soon nobody will be able to
   defeat us!

   450H 114V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NESW> sA Muddy Street Through Zeeriak
   You walk along the path leading out of Zeeriak. The road ahead seems
   less travelled than the one on which you arrived in town. Perhaps there
   is
   nothing to be found beyond Zeeriak but a cold death. The only
   inhabitants of
   this frigid wasteland are savage barbarians and cunning monsters.

   450H 111V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS> sA Muddy Street Through Zeeriak
   You walk along the path leading out of Zeeriak to the south. Ahead
   looms
   the forboding wildland of the tundra. Legend has it that far to the
   south,
   an ominous fortress stands upon a sheer cliff of ice. Only the very
   brave,
   or very stupid are said to seek it out, however. Looking to the south,
   the snow banks seem to end only when they meet the sky.

   450H 110V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS> sOn a Light Path
   Leaving what little safety Zeeriak offers behind, you trek south
   towards the seemingly neverending snowbanks of the tundra far to the
   south.
   You can barely make out a small, thin trail of smoke to the south
   through
   the snow around you.

   A warrior of the many icefolk tribes that inhabit the tundra is

   450H 108V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS> sOn a Light Path
   A cold wind blows across you from the far south hinting ever more at
   the chilling tundra that awaits you in that direction. You continue to
   glimpse a small trail of smoke to the south a ways off the path. You
   pull
   your cloak tighter around your neck, trying to push some of the cold
   away
   from you.

   Despite all the efforts of nature to ward you from this place, you
   continue to make your way south towards the icy tundra. The cold wind
   chills you to your bones and you bring your cloak up higher to try and
   shake off some of the bite. You can now see a light frost blanketing
   the
   plains ahead of you, and the cold has begun to sink into your boots,
   numbing your toes slightly.

   450H 102V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS> sA Frost Covered Trail
   Most of what was left of the trail you were following has been covered
   over by the frost that settles over the entire area. You can see small
   footprints dotting the snow. The cold wind turns your cheeks red and
   you
   find yourself constantly rubbing your hands together to try and get
   feeling
   back into them. Just a little ways to the south, you can see and smell
   the
   welcoming scent of a cook fire wafting into the crisp air. You're not
   sure
   what could be out here cooking, but the numbness of your feet says who
   cares.

   450H 100V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS> sOutside a Small Thatched Hut
   Some of the cold has abided some, leaving you with a warm feeling
   coming from a small hut to the east. The thatched roof of the hut has a
   large chimney made of hardened mud protruding from it, and wifts of
   smoke
   trail from it. The warm glow of a fire can be seen looking in the tiny
   door
   to the hut and you feel almost compelled to go in and warm yourself.

   450H 98V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NES> sTowards the Tundra
   You move ever closer to the white, icy plains of the tundra. The cold
   here has become much harsher, and the winds blow much harder and
   colder.
   You squint your eyes and look south, but the wind blurs your vision and
   all
   you can make out is white. A small hut to the north offers you some
   warmth
   and safety from the cold winds and hungry animals.

   Leaving the long trail from Tarsis behind you, you now stand on the
   edge of the mighty white tundra. The snow blows hard across the plains
   and
   the wind howls as it dances through the air. You huddle a little
   farther
   back into your cloak to try and remain a little warmer. Your cheeks
   have
   turned a bright red, and your hands have become a little stiff. To the
   north, you can no longer see Tarsis, but you know it is there
   somewhere.
   You can still make out thin smoke trailing from the hut you left
   behind. To
   the south, however, all you see is the white snow and awaiting cold.

   The corpse of a savage wolverine is lying here.
   450H 92V 3823021X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS> sOn the Tundra
   The cold arctic wind blows heavy across the frozen tundra, and you feel
   numbness creeping into your bones. All around you the snow blows and
   whisks
   by in small eddies and whirlwinds as it makes its way across the white
   plains. The snow beneath your feet is very thick and slows your
   movements
   as you try to keep awake in the cold and monotany of walking for hours
   without any change of scenery. You begin to wonder if you'll ever see
   an
   end to the white tundra.

   The snow and winds blow even harder as you move ever closer to the
   inner tundra. Somewhere in the distance, you can hear the howls of a
   wolf
   or some other creature that you can't imagine. Looking down at the
   snow,
   you can see the footprints that you have left in it, but as you turn to
   look back you can see that the swirling snow has already begun to cover
   your tracks and your way back.
