The Neraka Interceptor strikes again.

POV: Maxmillian

Log Rating: 1.9200

Only targeted Kuno, but in hindsight should have split up more targets.

You ran up charges of 1321 steel in rent.
Welcome to the land of Krynn.
The Reception
Although this inn does not look very reputable, at least it has warm
beds and anyhow, it is safer than sleeping in the streets of Neraka. A
small counter stands here with a little brass bell, although you should
not
use it for fear that the receptionist gets angry. It looks as if she
has
had a hard day already.
A rough, stringy animal sinew sits here decaying.
Sambo Ahma, Number Five is standing here. (red aura)
Khazgul Black, Corrupted By The Beauty Of Death is standing here.

The Seedy Inn
The blood stained floor is evident as soon as you enter. No attempt has
been made to hide last night's brawl. Obviously, such violence is
commonplace. Looking around, the locals hiss at you and sneer back into
their watered ale. A long bar, once made from fine oak, stands against
the
far wall. The many ales are displayed in their kegs in a corner.
Jeering
and shouts can be heard from the backroom to the north.
A large bulletin board is mounted on a wall here.
Some black dirt is scattered upon the ground.
