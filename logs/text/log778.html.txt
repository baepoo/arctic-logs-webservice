   ANALYSIS: After a long period of just wandering around, we totally
   owned everybody we came up against
   in the initial flurry of combat. All groups ran away from us & we only
   scored a few kills. Afterward,
   we kept catching straggers & were in the process of owning Kooz's group
   when Blixt & co walked in
   and, naturally, proceeded to kill me. Bad decision to gt bail instead
   BEFORE st;flee, it cost me my life.
   We won the round nonetheless.

   As someone bashes you mercilessly, you feel life ebb away and
   everything goes dark.
   Twinkling lights surround you and cover your body entirely.
   When they disappear, you find yourself somewhere else.
   Lie still, you are dead.
   You wish your wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!
   ANALYSIS: Complete disaster. I fled into FOUR different groups & every
   single caster was out to get me,
   as they should have been. Santino died in the initial mop up, and
   Helion got blinded & separated. With
   just me & Martinez left, it was a matter of time until we were
   eliminated.
