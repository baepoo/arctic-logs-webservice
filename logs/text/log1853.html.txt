   A Passage Within The Gate House
   A short inner passage runs through the gate house. The vaulted roof
   rises several feet above you and is adorned with carvings, though sadly
   many have worn away over the years. To your south lies the outer
   section
   which houses the massive ironwood doors and portcullis. It forms a
   circular
   archway. A fine shower of crumbling mortar rains down from above. You
   notice a few stones blocks have fallen from the walls. However the
   structure seems sturdy enough. In the shadows of the east and west
   walls
   are two smaller wooden doors. You figure they most likely lead up into
   the
   two towers flanking the gate house.
