   Akinyele RIP

   POV: Akinyele

   Log Rating: -1.6667

   Some russians kill me for a mismatched name rhyme. I guess 4 of the
   same letters in similar order constitutes a multi.

   Skellen flies in from the east.
   Eremius flies in from the east.
   Sorum flies in from the east.

   Eremius **MASSACRES YOU** with his cleave.
   You bludgeon Eremius hard.

   Skellen focuses harshly on you and utters some strange words.
   Skellen slowly fades into existence.
   Huge flames scorch you from above.
   That Really did HURT!

   Fredy focuses harshly on you and utters some strange words.
   You feel ribs shatter as Fredy's force bolt slams into you.

   Skellen focuses harshly on you and utters some strange words.
   Skellen slowly fades into existence.
   Huge flames scorch you from above.
   You are mortally wounded, and will die soon, if not aided.
   You can only lie still as the last heartbeat ebbs...
   You're dead.

   You sink gently to the ground.
   The metallic luster of your skin fades.
