   A Cavernous Lair
   This room is clearly inhabited by somebody or something, of great size,
   given that all of the huge cavern seems well used. By the hoard of
   valuables, jewelery, and coins that you can see toward the eastern side
   of
   the cave you would guess that whoever lives here must be quite
   powerful. A
   very wide passage leads on to the east, and the cavern continues west.
   A huge chest of gold rests here, covered by ice...it glows blue
   <Newb> Sphonx the Male Minotaur is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
   . . . has a tough exterior.
   <Newb> Bubs the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here. (flying)
