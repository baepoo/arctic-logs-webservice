   A Path Through the Ground Scrub
   The ground here is rocky and poorly vegetated. You are walking amongst
   mounds of sorted gravel and sand beds. Some mounds have been disturbed
   and
   you see glossy cores of ice exposed. Other features occur in the ground
   as
   depressions, where the ice-cored mounds have melted away and leaving
   the
   surface pitted. There is no set path here, you have to pick your way
   across
   this outwash plain.
   Topo, Harbinger of Fate is standing here. (flying)
   Charon the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here. (flying)
   Everon the Female Kender is standing here. (flying) (red aura)
   Silvane the Male Wild Elf is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
