Killing Takhisis's Children = Not Good Idea

POV: Matisyahu

Log Rating: -2.0833

Was on my way to daily prayers at temple to Takhisis and encountered an
intruder with evil plans. Log was cut off but heathen was blinded
entry.

A Dank Cellar
Two halls run perpendicular through the cellar here, one due north and
the other eastward. Shedding just enough light to see is a flickering
torch
on the southern wall, joined by a few that have burnt out and no longer
serve any purpose. The inherant dampness in the air is obvious here,
grungy
water trickles through a narrow crack to the west and spills onto the
floor. Thriving in the moisture, little insects burrow through the
rotting
wood beams along the ceiling and walls, adding to their struggle to
support
the massive building overhead.

A Dank Cellar
Three choices lay before you at this intersection. Towards the north
you see no immediate danger and south of here the cellar appears to be
empty save the little insects that live here, while to the east a row
of
cells lines the hallway. Decaying timbers barely support the heavy
ceiling
here, some of them stand only midway up the wall having collapsed under
their own weight. The cellar's air is fetid with the smell of rot and
decay, making you think twice before taking a deep breath.

A Cellar Hallway
The hallway takes a turn here, crooking eastward and further south. At
the far eastern corner of the cellar you can see a staircase through
the
gloomy torchlight, while directly west of you a solid wall of earth
impedes
movement. Thick oak timbers stand tall along the walls, supporting the
stone ceiling, though some are becoming warped and bowed by stress.
Light
is plentiful here, provided by a few newly lit torches attached to the
walls though the air is smokey and a bit smothering.

A Cellar Hallway
Yellow torchlight illuminates the area, provided by several torches
that are bracketed to the rock walls. A passage heads west, further
into

north, where it leads out of this basement floor. The air reeks of
mildew

Issuing from a room to the north, a horrid stench lingers in the air.
Pinpointing it's source is no trouble, even from here you can see
dozens of
torture devices coated in blood throughout the neighboring room.
Marking

in a
sconce, lighting this end of the hall. The stone wall is smooth to your
south, and leads straight west to continue the block.

An Underground Cellblock
The only item of interest here is a dark cell to the north, shadows
obstruct the corners and through its rusted iron bars its hard to see
much
of anything. Stone walls continue toward the west, where another cell
stands, and to the east where this hall ends. An eerie rhythmic sound
echoes in your ears from somewhere close by though it's hard to place.
A short shaft of black wood is rolling around here.

You hear a thumping sound coming from the south.
An Underground Cellblock
Curiously the southern wall here looks like it was once a cell door,
but is now sealed with stone and mortar. Directly north of it is an
equally
bizarre sight, a steel cell door frame is laden with magical runes and
scrawlings. Two torches on opposing sides of the room keep the hall
lit,
and further down the hall another cell resides behind the northern
wall. A
bit to the west the cell block ends at an intersection.

Entering the Cellblock
The end of the cellblock is relatively nondescript, the walls are bare
stone, as is the floor and ceiling. On either side of the room a bright
torch is fastened to the wall, spitting glowing embers into the musty
air.
Strange noises shortly catch your attention to the east, while the only
other direction to go is into an intersection west of here.
