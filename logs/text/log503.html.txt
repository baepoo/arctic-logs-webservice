   A Small Side Street
   You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
   up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the
   clouds
   above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
   decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the
   tree.
   The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue
   to
   the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching
   the
   ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the
   stairway.
   A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly
   A singing, happy dwarf stumbles along drunkenly.
