Murgen, Vishnu, Delamar Fight 2

POV:

Log Rating: 5.0000

Murgen, Vishnu, Delamar Vs. Gee, Cabardi, Mitutoyo. Not sure why
Mitutoyo wasn't in room, but for some reason they all targeted our
mage, so they died quick once it was 2 on 2. My parry owned Gee.

Someone says 'go'

Vishnu arrives from the south.
In a Dense Tropical Jungle
The foliage in this area is of considerable density, and the treetops
above grow close together and block out much of the sky. However,
enough
sunlight manages to creep through to light the area amply. You can hear
the
sounds of animals scurrying about in their daily activities and birds
chirping merrily as they wing from tree to tree, but you are unable to
find
visual proof of their presence.

The foliage in this area is of considerable density, and the treetops
above grow close together and block out much of the sky. However,
enough
sunlight manages to creep through to light the area amply. You can hear
the
sounds of animals scurrying about in their daily activities and birds
chirping merrily as they wing from tree to tree, but you are unable to
find
visual proof of their presence.
