   708H 109V 1X 2808C Exits:NESW> The Avenue of the Triumvirate
   Many houses of Vingaard's middle-class families stand on the north and
   south sides of this road as it passes east-west through the
   southwestern
   section of Vingaard. Most of the houses are made of stone, and are one
   to
   two stories tall. Short stone paths lead to the wooden front doors of
   the
   houses, with a few plants along its sides. Entrance to nearly all of
   the
   houses is prevented by gates that have been locked and barred, except
   to
   the south where the gate stands open. An array of small plants grows in
   the
   garden to the south, and the house appears to belong to a herbalist.
   A citizen of Vingaard walks through the street towards his home.

   Southern Avenue and The Avenue of the Triumvirate
   The cobblestone lanes of Southern Avenue and The Avenue of the
   Triumvirate intersect here. The edifices along the northern side of the
   Avenue of the Triumvirate are larger and grander than the buildings
   along
   the southern side, apparently because they serve a greater function
   than
   the houses that populate the street on the south side. The famed Temple
   of
   Paladine stands to the northeast, and another large stone building
   stands
   to the northwest. The central park is visible a bit to the north.
   The corpse of Powah is lying here.
   A sheaf of spellbook pages has been left here...it glows blue
   Khazgul Black, Corrupted By The Beauty Of Death is standing here.
