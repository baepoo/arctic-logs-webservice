   A Small Clearing
   A small clearing among the vallenwoods provides a place for the
   children of the Solace to play in safety. Several small children run
   amok,
   playing kick ball and other games. A huge vallenwood at the far edge of
   the
   clearing seems to house a shop of sorts. A small stairway spirals down
   from
   it, ending at the edge of the clearing. A small sign hangs by the
   stairway.
   A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly
