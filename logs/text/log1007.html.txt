   This neighborhood of Vingaard is inhabited by few except the peasants
   and the rats. The entire area contains little besides structures that
   are
   old, run down, and severely neglected due the peasants' lack of money.
   Although the Lords do provide adequate food for their citizens, their
   civic
   services are sorely lacking. The cobblestones beneath your feet have
   loosened from their once tight fit, and some have been completely
   knocked
   from the road. To the east stands a filthy building, with a sign

   The Lion and Eagle Inn
   The noble animals that are this inn's namesake are reflected little in
   it. Though the few candles in the room provide only a very dim light,
   it
   appears the inn's common room is in very poor repair. The chairs are
   old
   and cracking, and the surface of the tables are warped. A greasy bar
   stands
   to the south with several filthy mugs resting atop its surface. A sweet
   yet
   sickening smell hangs in the air, its source unknown until you notice a
   half-filled bowl of 'food.'
   A drunk sailor sits at a table getting a bit rowdy.

   Garug the innkeeper leans against a greasy bar. (white aura)
   A man in heavy brown robes sits here huddled over a table. (red aura)
