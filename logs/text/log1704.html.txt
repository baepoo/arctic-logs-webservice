   paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off

   fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
   grasses
   rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there
   is
   a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.
