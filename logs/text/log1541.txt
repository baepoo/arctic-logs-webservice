   Old Ex Inferis trying to steal our eq off Sigils. NOWclan does not
   tolerate such insolence.

   The Tollhouse
   This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
   Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
   A
   road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
   main
   keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
   for
   those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
   table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
   wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
   coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
   Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
   Palanthas,
   north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

   The noble animals that are this inn's namesake are reflected little in

   Western Perimeter Road
   This neighborhood of Vingaard is inhabited by few except the peasants
   and the rats. The entire area contains little besides structures that
   are
   old, run down, and severely neglected due the peasants' lack of money.
   Although the Lords do provide adequate food for their citizens, their
   civic
   services are sorely lacking. The cobblestones beneath your feet have
   loosened from their once tight fit, and some have been completely
   knocked
   from the road. To the east stands a filthy building, with a sign
   bearing an
   eagle and a lion out front.

   Western Perimeter Road and Southern Perimeter Road
   The two cobblestone roads of Western Perimeter and Southern Perimeter
   intersect here at the southwestern corner of the city. The city walls
   rise
   high above you as they extend both north and east along the outside
   edges
   of the perimeter roads. The two roads pass through predominately
   residential neighborhoods. Looking north, various dreary looking houses
   crowd the right side of the road, while to the east, the houses on the
   left
   appear to be in a slightly better condition. Pieces of trash litter the
   roads, and a powerful smell emanates from the filthy gutters.
   A crumpled piece of paper belonging in the trash lies here.

   Southern Perimeter Road
   This section of Southern Perimeter passes through a fairly poor section

   of
   this road are in very good condition, yet to appear to be inhabitable.
   Pieces of litter slowly fly around on the street as the wind pushes
   them
   along their way. The gutters along the sides of the street are fairly
   filthy, and a rather strong smell emanates from them. To the south,
   Vingaard's city wall rises above you, extending east and west.
   A cityguard marches down the street, keeping a vigilant eye for danger.

   Solamnus Way and Southern Perimeter Road
   The two roads of Solamnus and Southern Perimeter intersect here at the
   base of the town's large wall. The southwestern section of Vingaard
   appears
   to be residential, with mostly lower class families and individuals
   inhabiting the houses that appear along Southern Perimeter. The houses
   on
   Solamnus appear to be kept up a little better, and may belong to some
   middle-class families. A few street lamps are visible along Solamnus
   Way to
   the north, but none can be seen on Southern Perimeter as it makes its
   way
   to the east and west.
   A street sweeper stands here, sweeping up dirt and trash. (white aura)

   Southern Perimeter Road
   Home to some of Vingaard's poorer residents, the structures in this
   area reflect the poverty of their inhabitants. Few of the buildings
   have
   been kept up very well; most appear quite old and weathered. Pieces of
   trash float around in the streets, congregating mostly in the gutters
   with
   other waste. Peering down the street to the east, you notice that the
   edifices begin to show better upkeep and generally look nicer. To the
   south, Vingaard's city wall rises above you, extending far to the east
   and
   west.

   Southern Perimeter Road
   The peasants of Vingaard inhabit this fairly old section of the city.
   The structures that stand opposite the city wall to the south appear to
   kept up quite a bit better than those to the west. They are constructed
   mostly of wood and a single story, while some are stone and yet others
   are
   two stories. It seems as though the city's Lords have paid to keep up
   this
   part of the city because of its proximity to the main road through

   Southern Perimeter Road
   Buildings along this portion of Southern Perimeter have an odd look to
   them. They appear to be relatively neatly kept, clean, and structurally
   sound, yet have a strange quality. Looking west down the road, the
   structures visible look quite neglected. A quick glance at a face in
   the
   window reveals the presence of poverty. It seems as though the Lords of
   Vingaard have paid keep up the facades of these structures, probably
   due to
   their proximity to Southern Avenue, one of the pain roads through the
   town.
   A cityguard wanders through the town, keeping the peace. (white aura)

   Southern Avenue and Southern Perimeter Road
   The cobblestone lanes of Southern Avenue and Southern Perimeter Road
   intersect here. A tall stone wall runs the length of the southern side
   of
   the street, and various houses have been constructed along the northern
   side. A faint smell of smoke mixed with various other aromas can be
   sensed
   in the air, apparently coming from the chimneys of the nearby houses.
   Far
   to the north, at the end of Southern Avenue, the tall gates to
   Vingaard's
   central park are visible. A large archway in the wall leads south to
   the
   gates.

   This large tunnel, just behind the keep's gates, travels through the
   thick stone walls. The ceiling above you is curved and supported by
   several
   small arches, and two great arches stand on either end of this tunnel
   where
   they lead out into openness. The road's pavement is made of smooth,
   gray
   cobblestones about the size of your fist. Torches mounted on iron
   brackets
   provide almost all of the light for the tunnel. The air seems
   relatively
   stagnant throughout the tunnel, and mixes only with the fresh outside
   air
   at the ends. The cobblestone road heads north into the town of
   Vingaard,
   and south into the surrounding lands of grain.

   Vingaard's immense iron gates stand directly to the north, where they
   present a significant obstacle to any attacking force, but currently
   they
   have been raised high to allow passage of people and horses. High stone
   walls run east and west from here, extending quite a ways before
   turning
   beyond your vision. A road heads south where it quickly turns and heads
   west, passing the toll station as it travels through fields of grain,
   and a
   cobblestone avenue heads north through the gates.

   The Tollhouse
   This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
   Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
   A
   road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
   main
   keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
   for
   those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
   table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
   wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
   coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
   Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
   Palanthas,
   north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

   The Tollhouse
   This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
   Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
   A
   road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
   main
   keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
   for
   those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
   table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
   wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
   coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
   Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
   Palanthas,
   north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
