   A Path Around the Keep
   This path appears to be used heavily. It seems that the front gates of
   Storms Keep is used as rarely as possible. The massive walls of the
   keep
   rise to the east, towering high above you. Looking around you note that
   the
   storm that rages around the keep seems to have no effect on the keep or
   its
   inhabitants.

   The Inner Courtyard
   This area of the courtyard appears to be empty, although you feel eyes
   watching you. To the south is a huge wall, with a single archway
   leading
   back into the courtyard. The archway serves as a choke point; it would
   be
   an excellent tool to use in preparing an ambush. A path extends to the
   west, appearing to lead around the keep.

   A Guard Station
   This guard station serves as a buffer between the outer courtyard and
   the main keep. There is a small archway in the northern wall, and the
   courtyard extends in all other directions. The archway serves as a
   choke
   point: all access to the main keep passes through this station. If the
   keep
   were to be attacked, the intruders would have to pass through this arch
   as
   well, making it an excellent location for an ambush.

   Shouting and the sound of clashing metal fills the air. There are many
   knights training here, and they all appear to be very skilled. Looking
   at
   the teeming masses of training knights, you find that you have to
   constantly remind yourself that these are not Solamnic Knights,
   although
   their discipline and training rivals, maybe even surpasses, that of the
   Solamnic Knights.

   Courtyard in the Keep
   Broken swords, staves and shields have been pushed against the eastern
   wall here. The knights are training so intensely here that breaking
   weapons
   is almost a routine. Several Knights of the Thorn are training here,
   ready
   to assist the wounded, should the need arise. The stone floor is
   chipped
   and cracked in several places, no doubt another side effect from the
   large
   volume of training that goes on in this courtyard.

   Harsh winds and piercing rain pummels you as you make your way along

   the

   A Guard Station
   This guard station serves as a buffer between the outer courtyard and
   the main keep. There is a small archway in the northern wall, and the
   courtyard extends in all other directions. The archway serves as a
   choke
   point: all access to the main keep passes through this station. If the
   keep
   were to be attacked, the intruders would have to pass through this arch
   as
   well, making it an excellent location for an ambush.

   Courtyard in the Keep
   A constant veil of darkness is thrown over the courtyard of the keep
   caused by the clouds of the storm which always surrounds the keep. The
   large courtyard is over crowded with novices and knights in training.
   Few
   take notice of you, most disregarding you as more spies from the
   continent.
   The courtyard extends in nearly all directions before you, and further

   if

   Looming before you are the great adamantite gates of Storm's Keep.
   Detailing of lilies and borders of thorns accent the otherwise bland
   doors.
   Flanking the dark metal gates are high walls of blackened stone worn
   smooth
   by the constant beating of the rain. The wicked wind whips about your
   face
   wreathing about your body and chilling you to the bone. Lining the top
   of
   the wall are a couple of uninterested soldiers and a pair of stone
   guardians, shaped like dragons and carved to resemble the living. The
   overall affect is quite frightening and it puts an awkward weight upon
   your

   The Inner Courtyard
   This area of the courtyard appears to be empty, although you feel eyes
   watching you. To the south is a huge wall, with a single archway
   leading
   back into the courtyard. The archway serves as a choke point; it would
