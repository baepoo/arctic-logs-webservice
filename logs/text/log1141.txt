   The Executioners Block
   You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
   into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden
   platform
   at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
   onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped
   up
   against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The
   wooden
   platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a
   poor
   cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to
   the
   east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation
   of
   evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.
   A Balifor watchman watches for trouble in the city.
   The lord high executioner grins at you, fondling his axe lovingly.
   166V 13918566X 82C Exits:NEW> Death Row
   Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
   executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark
   and
   evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are
   boarded
   up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
   point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is
   nicknamed
   'Death Row'.
   The corpse of a priest of Hiddukel is lying here.
   The corpse of a wandering preacher is lying here.
   A key made of silver lays upon the floor.
   A Balifor watchman watches for trouble in the city.
   A feral cat parades her territory and sniffs your leg.

   165V 13918566X 82C Exits:EW> The Tavern Square
   Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
   races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
   peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A
   dark
   alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
   executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street
   and
   the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp
   on
   the tavern wall.
