   Consequence of Actions

   POV: Nero

   Log Rating: -2.4349

   Mercator learns that words are actions too, and sometimes carry
   consequences.

   Looking north:
   The area to the north seems a bit lighter than this area of the cavern.
   Rinad the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here.
   Lord Guenhwyvar Templaran, Guarding Paladins Way to the Light is
   standing here.
   Mercator the Male Human is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
   Looking east:
   You see nothing special.
   Looking south:
   Light is visible to the south, coming from the entrance to the cave.
   Looking west:
   You see nothing special.
   Looking up:
   The sloping ceiling of the cavern is made of tough grey stone.
   Looking down:
   Hardened grey stone makes up the ground.

   Deeper Inside the Cave
   A small hole in the ceiling above provides a bit of fresh air for the
   area, though it is too small to make much of a difference in terms of
   the
   mustiness. Because the ceiling is far above, and there is no way to
   climb
   up the slippery, moss-covered walls to it, the hole is rendered useless
   as
   an exit. One can continue northwards deeper into the cavern, as well as
   south back towards the entrance.
   Rinad the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here.
   Lord Guenhwyvar Templaran, Guarding Paladins Way to the Light is
   standing here.
