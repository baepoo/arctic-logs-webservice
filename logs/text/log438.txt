A Crossroads in the Khalkist Foothills
You arrive upon a three way crossroads in the foothills of the
Khalkists. As you examine the three different directions, you only
notice
that each passes through the barren Khalkist foothills, which spread
all
around you. Other than these foothills, you are only able to make out
some
large mountains in each direction which further block your view of
anything
beyond them.
A mountain spring bubbles out of the rocks into a small pool.
A small sign stands just off the road.
A plain looking key lies here.
A smoked sausage has been left here. Smells wonderful.
Clash the Male Half Elf is resting here.
A mighty clydesdale stands before you.
A stallion is tethered here.

You utter the words, 'paralysis'
Clash is paralyzed!

Who should the spell be cast upon?
272H 82V 4879475X 1011C Mem:2 Exits:NSW> You utter the words, 'flame
shroud'
You smell charred flesh as you enshroud Clash in a cloak of flames.

IN 10 SECONDS.
You massacre Clash with your bludgeon.
272H 82V 4879475X 1011C [Me:Perfect] [Clash:V.Bad] Mem:2 Exits:NSW> You
utter the words, 'flame shroud'
Clash dies a fiery death as you enshroud him in a cloak of burning
flames.
You receive 0 experience.
Clash is dead! R.I.P.
272H 82V 4879475X 1011C [Me:Perfect] [Clash:Dying] Mem:2 Exits:NSW>
The death cry of Clash echoes from somewhere nearby...
Cael stops following Clash.
A clydesdale stops following Clash.
