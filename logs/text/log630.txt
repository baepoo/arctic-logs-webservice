The Lion and Eagle Inn
The noble animals that are this inn's namesake are reflected little in
it. Though the few candles in the room provide only a very dim light,
it
appears the inn's common room is in very poor repair. The chairs are
old
and cracking, and the surface of the tables are warped. A greasy bar
stands
to the south with several filthy mugs resting atop its surface. A sweet
yet
sickening smell hangs in the air, its source unknown until you notice a
half-filled bowl of 'food.'
A street sweeper stands here, sweeping up dirt and trash.
Xellos Mite, Tenken of Vae Victus is standing here.

Entrance to the Mines
This short passageway leads from the staircase to the west to a huge
mineshaft to the east. The mineshaft is closed off by a large metal
door
that appears to be locked from within. Through a small opening in the
door,
you can see the mineshaft falling off far below but strangely, you
cannot
hear any sounds of workers.

Bottom of a Huge Spiral Staircase
This staircase spirals for what seems like miles upward. The staircase
is poorly lit and it's hard to see far, which further enhances the
feeling
that the stairs go on forever. Carvings dominate all sides of the
stairwell, depicting scenes from ancient dwarven history. A passage way
opens up to the east, leading to a huge metal gate.
A servant walks around here.
