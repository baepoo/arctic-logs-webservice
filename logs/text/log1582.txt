   Korpiklani vs. Kyro

   POV: Kyro

   Log Rating: -1.5556

   Something can be said for Korpiklani's bravery, at least.

   470H 115V 1X 53C Exits:D> Sorcerer's Lounge
   This lounge area looks almost like a library. Bookshelves line all
   four walls of this room. Many young mages spend their breaks here
   studying.
   A set of creaky wooden steps lead up into a large classroom.
   Korpiklani the Female Theiwar Dwarf is standing here.

   470H 114V 1X 53C [Me:Perfect] [Korpiklani:V.Bad] Exits:NU> Entrance to
   the School
   The building is not very large and looks quite humble. The master of
   this school is an elven maiden; rumors have it she is a great
   enchantress.
   But because of the mages' esoteric nature, people really aren't
   certain.
