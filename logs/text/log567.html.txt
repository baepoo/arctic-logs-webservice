   Tza clan begins randoming yet again.

   POV: Jojo

   Log Rating: 1.8000

   Well I was trying to level around the Palanthas area, when Arayel
   focused harshly on me. So I lured him to the west gates to try and have
   the guards help me, but then his clan came to back him up. I guess
   these players aren't as innocent as they say. To clan tza: you
   randomers make this game no fun for us normal players.
