   Darien + Emili = Love

   POV:

   Log Rating: 0.0000

   Darien loves Emili so much that he just can't let her stand. And in
   response, Emili refused to recall when could! What a beautiful
   relationship.

   The wonderful smell of spiced potatoes makes
   your stomach rumble.
   The Inn of the Last Home
   The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
   the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace
   dominates
   one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill
   the
   room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another
   stairway
   leads down to the forest below.
   Emili la Ru, Renshai's Black Armadillo for Covert Operations is
