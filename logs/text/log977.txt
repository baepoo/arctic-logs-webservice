   The semi-great escape.

   POV: Vinoa

   Log Rating: 1.0715

   Having flags on me and group members, I decide it would be smart to get
   a special wand and run to solace treehouse.

   Inn of the Last Call
   A large desk sits near the northern wall, a rack with many keys hanging
   on it is on the wall. Two hallways lead off to the east and west, lined
   with doors leading to the most comfortable rooms in Port o'Call. A
   staircase leads down into the main part of the inn, from that direction
   you
   smell some great food and it sounds like there is a party going on! A
   small
   oil lamp sits on the desk lighting the room for those arriving late at
   night.
   The innkeeper stands behind the counter looking at his guest list.

   18H 123V 7776276X 3380C Exits:D> The Last Call
   The bright torch light shines in your eyes as you step from the street
   and into The Last Call. Laughter can be heard from every corner of the
   room
   as the patrons enjoy their drinking and fun. Tables are spread about
   the
   room for people to sit and enjoy their meals. You can see a large set
   of
   stairs leading up to the rooms of the inn. Judging by what you see down
   here, the rooms upstairs are probably very nice and cozy. A few people
   in
   the bar smile and wave at you as you enter, making you feel very
   welcome.
   A waitress stands here wondering if you are going to order something.
   18H 122V 7776276X 3380C Exits:WU> A Road through Port o'Call
   You smell the wonderful odor of fish cooking to the east, and you can
   hear loud fits of laughter coming from that direction. Looking at the
   sign
   above the door, it reads 'The Last Call'. You smile quietly to yourself
   as
   you hear more laughter come from within. Perhaps this might be a nice
   place
   to spend the evening.

   The Vallenwood Trunk
   You are climbing the huge vallenwood tree. You hear the sounds of
   singing birds and other forest animals. Exits lead in all directions.
   A sparrow is perched here resting.
   The furry squirrel is here, munching a bit from his winter stores.

   Higher on the Trunk
   You are high on the trunk of a huge vallenwood tree. The altitude makes
   you dizzy and lightheaded. Branches lead out in all directions and the
   trunk continues up.

   18H 45V 7776276X 3380C Exits:NESWUD> Yet Another Branch
   You carefully move out onto another branch. You see the ground far
   below and suddenly you get dizzy. What are you doing up here anyway?
   The
   tree is west.
   A black raven sits here staring at you blankly.

   The Top of the Vallenwood
   You are a top the huge vallenwood tree. You hang out into nothingness
   and feel the wind push you towards open space. You can see the entire
   world
   from here. You can either go out on the limb to the east, or climb back
   down the tree.

   18H 39V 7776276X 3380C Exits:ED> Out on a Thin Limb
   High up in a vallenwood tree the view is quite spectactular. You can
   see for miles in every direction. To the north you can see the
   vallenwoods
   of Solace and make out the Inn of the Last Home. The wind up this high
   is
   strong and the branches thin, in fact the one you are on has just
   snapped...
   18H 37V 7776276X 3380C Exits:WD>
   A strong gust of wind forces you down.
   Falling Through the Air
   You are in mid-air, between the top of the tree and the base of the
   tree. The ground looks a lot bigger than it was a few seconds ago.
   18H 37V 7776276X 3380C Exits:UD> You plummet to the ground below...
   At the Base of the Vallenwood
   You are at the base of a vallenwood tree. There are imprints on the
   ground here, in the shape of a human, almost as if someone landed here
   after falling from the tree.
   You hit the ground with great force and break your neck!
   You're dead.
   Your detect invisibility wears off.
   You stop following someone.
