   Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
   stretches to the north and to the south, escaping the horizon. Quiet
   and
   depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
   heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
   highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and
   weeds.
   The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire.

   the

   East Bank of the Vingaard River
   A large campsite is set up here, designed as a stopping point for weary
   travelers and caravans before crossing the Vingaard River. The river

   runs from the north to the south, cutting off the road just to the
   west.
   The river flows gently through here, making it easy to ford and cross

   Fording the Vingaard River
   The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
   place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
   scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish
   can
   be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a
   morsel
   of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
   relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would
   be
   wise.

   The West Bank
   The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
   built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
   humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to
   control
   to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area
   due
   the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies
   have
   tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
   world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking
   to
   trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through
   the
   center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

   Nearing the City of Vingaard
   The road here passes through some large fields of grain, a sign that a
   large city is nearby. Looking westward, the towers of Vingaard Keep are
   visible perched atop a hill with the city's walls nearby. The road
   continues north to a junction of roads from other parts of the
   continent
   and a small tollhouse that stands watch over the intersection. To the
   south, the road crosses the Vingaard River via a ford in the river.

   The Tollhouse
   This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
   Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
   A
   road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
   main
   keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
   for
   those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
   table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
   wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
   coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
   Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
   Palanthas,
   north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

   The Knights' High Road
   The Knights' High Road ends here, just west of the city of Vingaard.
   The city's massive town wall surrounds the city just to the northeast,
   while perched atop a hill to the southeast is the main keep, and
   impressive
   fortification. Large swatches of fertile farmlands surround the town,
   and a
   small road leads off to the north through them. Directly to the east is
   a
   small two-story stone structure, the tollhouse, used to collect taxes
   from
   people passing through the area.

   The Knights' High Road
   You travel along a very long road, extending as far as you can see
   through the seemingly endless Solamnic Plain. The road is wide and
   obviously heavily used, though some tracks seem a bit old. The
   occasional
   bird flies high overhead, quietly cruising around searching for prey. A
   light breeze blows, carrying the sweet smell of the plains with it. The
   road extends west-northwest toward Palanthas and east-southeast to
   Vingaard, its keep perched atop a hill barely visible on the horizon.

   Stretching out from horizon to horizon, the Knights' High Road passes
   through the Solamnic Plain, connecting the city of Vingaard with the
   lord
   city of Palanthas. The shining jewel of Solamnia, Palanthas lies far to
   the west and north, beyond Westgate Pass in the Vingaard Mountains,
   while
   the city of Vingaard lies east-south-east of here. The tall grasses of
   the

   The Knights' High Road
   Stretching out from horizon to horizon, the Knights' High Road passes
   through the Solamnic Plain, connecting the city of Vingaard with the
   lord
   city of Palanthas. The shining jewel of Solamnia, Palanthas lies far to
   the
   west and north, beyond Westgate Pass in the Vingaard Mountains, while
   the
   city of Vingaard lies east-south-east of here. The tall grasses of the
   plains seem to go on forever, gently swaying back and forth with the
   breeze. Barely visible far to the west are a few mountain peaks.

   Near the Virkhus Hills
   The road continues from here, traveling to the north and south. The
   vast Solamnic Plain stretches out into the eastern horizon, while the
   Virkhus hills lie to the west and north. Tall grasses along side sway
   gently in the wind. The Knights' High Road, the main link between
   Vingaard
   to the east and Palanthas to the west, extends eastward far beyond your
   vision. The road is wide and obviously heavily traveled, though traffic
   seems to be dwindling as reports of war gain credibility.

   The Virkhus Hills
   These rolling hills lie just west of the Solamnic Plain, separating the

   The road winds its way between the hills, gently rising and falling. To
   the
   sides of the roads lie expansive grasslands, gently swaying in the

   The air is clean and refreshing. The road extends westward through the

   The Wings of Habbakuk
   Situated right between the Vingaard Mountains to the west, and the

   rise
   up high above you. A small creek runs along a portion of the road here,
   and
   then turns away towards a lake at the heart of this lush valley. Tall
   green
   grasses grow all around, beautiful patterns emerging as the wind blows
   their tops back and forth. A large bird occasionally flies by high
   overhead, searching for prey. The road stretches east and west through
   the
   green valley.

   Vingaard Mountains. Tall evergreen trees stand nearby, their long, wide
   branches swaying gently in the light breeze that blows. Looking west to
   the
   mountains, a few snow-capped peaks are barely visible high above. Down
   the
   road to the east lies the Wings of Habbakuk, a large grassy valley
   nestled
   between the Vingaard Mountains and the Virkhus Hills.

   Near Westgate Pass
   Directly to the north, the High Clerist Tower rises skyward, reaching
   higher than any other structure on Krynn. The tower, an ancient bastion
   of
   the Solamnic Knighthood, stands just to the side of Westgate pass. The
   Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
   northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies
   beyond. A few snow-capped peaks of the Vingaard Mountains can be seen
   in
   the distance, their impressive heights dwarfed by the massive tower. To
   the
   south, the road leads back down to the plains through the mountains.
