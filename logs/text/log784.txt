The Ebullient Elephant Inn
This spacious tavern is full of customers. This is obviously a favorite
hangout of many of Palanthas's middle class citizens. There is a bar
against one wall and a staircase leading upstairs to the room clerk's
office. The only exit is back north to Sword Street.
Floyd, the barkeep, idly whistles a merry tune while polishing the bar.

Anatole's Amazing Artifacts
This building smells awful. Probably from all the noxious fumes from
the lab in the next room. But then again, everybody knows magicians
stink.
The counter is actually a glass case that displays several magical
trinkets. The only exits are back north to Sword Street, and a small
archway leading east.
A small roll of bread lies here.
An apprentice mage is here watching the store for his master.
