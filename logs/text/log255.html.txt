   Grun RIP

   POV: Limper

   Log Rating: 2.5000

   We didn't give them enough time to prepare.

   Within the Wardrobe
   You now stand in the middle of a large, cedar wardrobe. To every side
   there are massive amounts of clothing, making it difficult to move
   about.
   You scrounge about in search of anything of value, but only find mounds
   and
   mounds of clothing piled on top of a heap of shoes and boots.
