   A Cobbled Road
   The road is wide here and paved with cobblestone in spots. You see the
   marks of a wagon in the dirt spots of the road, left by the increasing
   number of merchants travelling between Newport and the towns of Solace
   and
   Haven. Around you the landscape is dotted with trees and the area is
   hilly.
   In the air you can faintly smell salt, carried by a breeze blowing from
   the
   northeast. The road leads to the north and east from here. Southeast
   you can
   hear the sounds of a bustling town and to the north you hear a low
   rumbling.
