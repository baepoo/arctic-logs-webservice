   Wrath of Kon vs RGB's

   POV: Krovax

   Log Rating: 2.4614

   I let Oleg waist all his holds on my leet wild elf saves
   and then I get jiggy wit it. Reason why I was playing around
   with 100 evils on and 0 goodguys is because I wanted to test
   out my new stabber the Wrath of Kon that I got from tourney,
   there wern't any evil bashers on till after Klara died the
   first time so I was pretty safe, and I was pretty nakid eq
   wise.

   This is Vingaard Avenue, a well traveled street that runs north-south
   through Kalaman. Just to the north, you see the busy city square and
   Kalaman's own open air bazaar is to the east and west. Looking
   southward,
   you see the Traveler's Lodge, where most visitors to Kalaman stay.

   Open Air Bazaar of Kalaman
   This is the famous open air bazaar of Kalaman. Many merchants travel
   from far away places to do business at the bazaar. It is very crowded
   here.
   Many of the citizens come here to shop or to just browse around. Some
   of
   the items being sold are quite interesting, but you can't think of any
   uses
   you would have for them.
   A street cleaner is walking about, cleaning up the trash.
