   Battle of Kalaman
   [26]View Comments (46)

   POV: Weep

   Log Rating: 3.0000

   CORE and Wild join forces to battle BSP.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ---------
   The battle of Kalaman begins with Reykas dying to Wild.
   We attempt to hunt Wild to avenge Reykas, but are unable to reach them.
   Meanwhile, CORE has been hunting us for 25+ minutes via astral beacon
   and clair.
   We decide to oblige CORE by making ourselves somewhat easier to locate.
