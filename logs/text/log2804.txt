You are King Zearin, Destroyer of Worlds

POV: Zearin

Log Rating: -0.1818

Short summary: BSP mages started poofing me and attacking me. Namtara
was afk in the inn after and so he died. Nooka died a few days after.
Sotofa RIP'ed as well but can't find the log. For Sol and Catharsis,
BSP attacked me but fell short, and that is why I was able to attack in
peace rooms. Only a matter of time before I die considering I'm vastly
outnumbered, but at least I took down a few before I will die.
