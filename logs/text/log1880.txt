   Tananathalas says 'haha nice death'

   POV: Consuela

   Log Rating: 3.1765

   This drunkwhore, who tried to start a war with Kirath once already,
   poofs to us while learning Gaard and starts harassing about "his +heal
   decayed and is loaded". When he doesn't get the response he desires he
   becomes an ass and subsequently dies.. twice.. quite funnily.

   A cheetah rakshasa arrives from the east.
   A cheetah rakshasa gives his dagger a quick thrust and twist, as he
   strikes Koe in the back with it.
