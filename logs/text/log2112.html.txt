   A Highway Through the Plains
   Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
   stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
   depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
   heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
   highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and
   weeds.
   The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire.
   The huge umber hulk lumbers towards you.
   You sense a life form.
