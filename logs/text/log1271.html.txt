   On the Road
   Shouts are heard somewhere nearby. Possibly north, towards the middle
   section of this transient station for mercenaries, and servants of the
   Dark
   Queen. It seems as if the smoke filling the air will never cease to
   inhabit
   your lungs, causing frustration in your mind. A slight breeze blows
   down
   from the mountains to the south. The fresh cool air soothes your sweat
   filled body. The guard towers still loom ahead of you though, which
   brings
   you back to concentrating on what your next move will be.

   Leaving the unpleasant odor of the camp to your northwest, you press on
   down the road. In the distance to the south, what appears to be two
   large
   guard towers line the sides of the road allowing the occupants of this
   area
   to keep watch on all comers. A noise from the forest startles you and
   you
   look up to see a small bird take flight into the distance.
