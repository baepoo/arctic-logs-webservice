Looking north:
The side of a pale blue tent, beyond which a forest begins.
Looking east:
The side of a faded, yellow tent, beyond which a row of similar tents
extend.
Looking south:
A grassy meadow, upon which a camp has been raised, runs astride a
forest.
Lilly, Pure as the Yellow Snow is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
. . . is surrounded by d duplicate images.
An energetic young boy dashes about the camp, busily running errands.

A saw-laden older man tiredly walks past you, his mind elsewhere.
A tanned, sweaty peasant marches diligently past, despite signs of
fatigue.
Looking west:
The grassy meadow reaches the edge of a dense forest.
Looking up:
Branches of the great trees to the west obscure the sky from your
sight.
Looking down:
The grass growing here is yet still long, and has yet to be trampled
down.
