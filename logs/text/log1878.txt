   The Dragonarmy Training Grounds
   Near the northern wall a stairway leads down a small opening, protected
   by metal railings. The training grounds spread out to your south and
   west,
   and to the east a crude wall and leather tarp serve as walls for a
   temporary medical facility. Sharp bits of metal from broken swords and
   armor slide across the stone floor as you step into them, producing a
   series of metallic clangs. It's hard to open your eyes and not see a
   streak
   of blood across something in this area, and the air stinks of it.
   A pile of steel coins.
   A battered longsword is lying here, forgotten.

   In a Mess Hall
   Recruits run a night shift, rushing around the cafeteria to prepare it
   for tomorrow. The tables are lined up in straight rows, and tucked
   neatly
   underneath them are short wooden stools. A huge oven is close by to the
   south, though it's fire is extinguished for the night. To the west two
   archways head out of the mess hall into a stone hallway.

   West End of Bridge
   Groaning loudly, the wood of the bridge slightly gives way as you step
   on it. In the distance, across the waters of silver, buried beneath a
   shroud of white, the thin wailing reverberates through the air. Ghostly
   shapes, high above, flit about in the maze of fog, like the noble
   steeds of
   a chariot they pull the wailing of the banshee across the lands. Over
   the
   bridge, both southward and northward, the river boils violently,
   bubbles
   burst spraying scalding water across the surface of the bridge.
