Inner Landing
You find yourself in the inner landing of the great guard house of
Qualinost. The elves are highly protective of their privacy and these
great
gates serve as testaments to their mistrust of outsiders. The hall
itself
is adorned with paintings of nature, elves in somber clothes and the
pantheon of good. The pantheon, however, has a distinctly elven look to
it.

You are in a nondescript connecting hallway that leads to a large gate,

oak
wood. The gate is unbelievably sized for this however, as it is more
than
twenty feet across. The polished wood within the hallway gives off a
welcoming ambiance that seems to set you off guard.
