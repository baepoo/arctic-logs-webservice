   The Palanthas Sewers
   A dampness fills the air and a light breeze blows the scent of salt to
   you from the north. In between the infrequent breezes and the smell of
   salt, another odor reaches you. This one however is overpoweringly foul
   and
   rank. Garbage is strewn about here and there and you see a few
   footprints
   on the ground. The tunnel continues on to the north and south off into
   the
   darkness. The walls and ceiling are shored up by stone archways that
   were
   built every fifteen feet or so. A stone sconce sits on both sides of
   the
   tunnel walls, the torches in them burnt out ages ago. Puddles of dank
   and
   stagnant water sit depressions in the floor, continuously filled by
   drips
   from above.
