The demon Marilith arrives from the north.
Solace Square
Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here.
The corpse of Rhaegar is lying here.
A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.
The Demon Marilith is here, writhing its snake-like tail.
A janitor is walking around, cleaning up.

east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at

The Inn of the Last Home
The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. To the south a huge
fireplace can be seen. Small tables fill the room, and at each sits at
least one or two people, the majority of which are in deep
conversation. At
one of the tables, a young elf is busy playing a beautiful tune on a
small
golden harp.
A large bulletin board is mounted on a wall here.
A red-haired young lady is wiping down a table here.
The regal Solace constable is here, protecting the innocent from harm.
A young elf is making a few coins by playing his harp for the locals.
A tall stone-faced barbarian stands guard over his lover.
A beautiful woman sits here, clasping a plain wooden staff.
Tanis Half-Elven paces the room looking concerned.

The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace
dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill
the
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another
stairway
leads down to the forest below.
A piece of dried red clay has been dropped here...it glows blue
A small child plays with some colorful objects. (white aura)

The demon Marilith flies in from the east.
The Entrance to the Halls of Myth
Ringing, from hammer on anvil, and hissing, from quenching of heated
metal, fills the ears upon entering this lively and active smithy. A
steady repairing of all the weapons, armor, and artifacts brought to
the
smithy fills the day for most of the workers here. A small contingent,
though, appears to be dedicated to making both kitchenware and
horseshoes.
Certainly, if something needed repairing this would be an appropriate
place to have the work done.
You notice some bloody footprints on the ground.
The Demon Marilith is here, writhing its snake-like tail. (flying)
The stronghold's blacksmith is standing here, flexing his muscles.

The Halls of Myth
You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is
a
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and
bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
