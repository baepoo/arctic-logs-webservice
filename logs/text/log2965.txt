You see nothing special about her.
<VA> Lincraff the young adult female hill dwarf is in an excellent
condition.
Neophyte of Vengeful Ambition.
Lincraff is using:
<worn around neck> a blood red cape..it glows dimly
<worn around neck> a white necklace of large beads..it glows dimly
<worn on head> a crown of heliconia flowers..it glows dimly
<worn on feet> some soft leather boots
<worn as shield> a black ice shield..it glows dimly
<worn about body> a shimmering purple robe..it glows dimly
<worn around right wrist> a grey leather bracer
<used in primary hand> a drasil wood druidic stick
<held in secondary hand> a rotted academic tome
You attempt to peek at her inventory:
a scroll of recall
a torch
a small wooden chest

Eight short squat circular columns support the ceiling of this long

The Practice Room
The room appears to be a practice room of sorts. Several mannequins
clothed in peasant attire hang from ropes in several points, the
clothing
covered with small bells. In another part of the room several targets
have
been placed against the wall, their wooden surfaces marred by the marks
of
hundreds of dagger throws. Scores of various paraphenalia dot the rest
of the
room, almost each of which is in use by an enterprising young pupil.
A tall man clad in brown leathers walks about as he instructs his
students.
