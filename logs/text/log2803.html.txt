   The Que-teh Stables
   A large fence has been erected a small distance to the west of Que-teh
   village. Inside are the four or five quarterhorses used by the
   chieftain's
   messengers and elite guards. As you approach, you notice that this
   small

   The corpse of Swiftfoot is lying here.
   Bryton the Male Human is resting here.
   . . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.
