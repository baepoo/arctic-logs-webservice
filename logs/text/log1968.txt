North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.
