   562H 88V 15640329X 497C Exits:NEWD> eAt the Helm of a Passenger Ship
   Standing near the helm of this ship, you are suprised at the lack of
   navigational equipment. You determine that this ship could hardly
   handle
   rough open waters, so it stands to reason that a good captain could
   easily
   navigate with only a detailed knowledge of the coastline. This fact
   makes
   the presence of a good, sober captain a must in order for this ship to
   sail.
   A long grey rat crawls along the edges of the docks.
   Lord Daemyon Angelfist, Wandering Avenger of Paladine is sitting here,
   fighting the captain. (white aura)

   encompassing all the armor and weapons you are ever likely to need.
   Unfortunately, some of the better ones are in cabinets with 'Not for

   Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
   races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
   peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A
   dark
   alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
   executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street
   and
   the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp
   on
   the tavern wall.

   Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
   executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark
   and
   evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are
   boarded
   up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
   point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is
   nicknamed
   'Death Row'.

   You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
   into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden
   platform
   at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
   onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped
   up
   against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The
   wooden
   platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a
   poor
   cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to
   the
   east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation
   of
   evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.
   A feral cat parades her territory and sniffs your leg.

   You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
   into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden
   platform
   at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
   onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped
   up
   against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The
   wooden
   platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a
   poor
   cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to
   the

   of
   evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

   boarded
   up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing

   fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in
   the
   corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit
   and
   relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to

   Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
   executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark
   and
   evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are
   boarded
   up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
   point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is
   nicknamed
   'Death Row'.
   411H 125V 15640161X 440C Exits:EW> wThe Tavern Square
   Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
   races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
   peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A
   dark
   alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
   executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street
   and
   the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp
   on
   the tavern wall.
   A young kender stands here, looking about curiously.
   A Balifor watchman is standing here, fighting Daemyon.
