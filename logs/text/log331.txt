Vallenwood Lane
The lane widens into the front yard of a large and comfortable-looking
inn. The inn seems less to have been built as much as grown from the
very

the second story windows, but someday they'll tower over the inn's red
tile
roof. A large sign hanging over the entrance creaks slightly as it
moves in
the breeze.
