A conversation about a gazer's eye.

POV: Tuuli

Log Rating: 1.0953

A small debate over who the eye belonged to. Nobody considered the
possibility it belonged to the poor now blind gazer.

-----------------------------------
Events so far: me (Tuuli), Azura and Halko group with a Shadow group
to do qualinesti, it turns out that nobash item, gazer's eye, is loaded
and Halko happens to be the first to loot it, he hands it over to me.
Zoe demands us to give the eye to him, which we of course refuse
because we have own interest in having it too, simple conversation
doesnt
seem the dispute any further, heres how it goes:
