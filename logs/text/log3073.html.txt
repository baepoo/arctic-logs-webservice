   The Den of the Armaboros
   The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
   this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the
   skull
   of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two
   minotaurs
   wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such
   a
   beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though,
   would
   truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
   eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
   armaboro den continues north.
   The corpse of a battle-scarred armaboro is lying here. [2]
   You see the outline of a life form here, carrying: the dark orb of
   souls; a dragon necklace of Takhisis; the robes of darkness.

   Behind the Dragon's Skull
   Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
   dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and
   the
   mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly
   pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
   terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints
   seem
   to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.
   You see the outline of a life form here, carrying: the dark orb of
   souls; a dragon necklace of Takhisis; the robes of darkness.

   A Muddy Path
   The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
   different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a
   dwarf
   will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his
   thighs
   in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since
   the
   mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling
   atmosphere.
   The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
   alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

   A Muddy Path
   Viscous streams of the sweet-smelling, orange-tan mud spills forth from
   an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of
   mud in
   this room. Looking down, huge body prints have been cast where
   armaboros
   have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a
   little bit easier to move in, since, here, you are forced to swim.

   A Hot, Muddy Spring
   Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
   apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for
   the
   strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
   sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
   region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is
   somewhat
   intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever.
   Of
   course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
   just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
   below.

   Fabulous aromas assault the senses from all sides of this compact

   being a
