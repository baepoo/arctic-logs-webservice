   Solace Square
   Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
   huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
   their
   limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
   clearing
   here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
   spot
   in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
   north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
   huge
   vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some
   sorts.
   A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
   the
   thick limbs which house the guild hall.
   A long torch functions as a street lamp here.
   A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.

   Western Avenue
   Western Avenue winds among the huge vallenwoods which house Solace. The
   dark green canopy overhead forms a protective shield from the outside
   world. Small forest creatures abound here. Dense forest foliage lines
   the
   edges of the avenue. A small clearing stretches south from the edge of
   the
   road here. The avenue itself leads west and east from here.

   Eastern Avenue
   The road is cut from among the huge vallenwoods which protect and house
   the inhabitants of Solace. The limbs overhead entwine with one another
   to
   provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the
   sun,
   while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large
   vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you
   notice a
   rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway
   spirals
   down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the
   temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west
   towards
   Solace Square.

   Intersection of Eastern Avenue and Perimeter Street
   Two forest roads intersect here beneath the canopy of vallenwood limbs.
   Both twist and turn through the thick forest that Solace has thrived
   in.
   Eastern Avenue runs from the east and west. Another small road cuts off
   to
   the north.

   The Solace Cafe
   This is a small cafe. The room is filled with small tables. These
   tables are occupied by various Solace citizens who are relaxing and
   enjoying themselves. This looks like a good place to relax and take a
   drink. You notice a small stairway leading down.
