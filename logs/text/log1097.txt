An Herbal Garden
This garden is very well maintained, but the strange thing is the
plants that are growing here. Nothing looks like what you would expect
to
find in a garden. There are no tomatoes, beans or squash. Actually
nothing
looks like anything you have ever seen on a plate, unless that one
plant
happens to be parsley. The dirt has been freshly turned, in fact the
hoe is
still laying here. In the dirt you can see a few footprints, but they
all
appear to be the same size, so it is probably safe to assume only one
person has been working here.
The corpse of Dali is lying here.
A small roll of bread lies here. [22]
Grouch, The Ragged Leather Druid is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
. . . is surrounded by a white mist.
Drood, Gnomish Weatherman is standing here. (flying)
. . . is surrounded by a shimmering light.
Acleif is standing here. (flying)
. . . has a metallic luster.
