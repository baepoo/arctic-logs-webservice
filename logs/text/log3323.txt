   Manners go a long way.

   I was on my level 25 thief, hunting down the sponge to train some
   skills. I happen upon this guy and simply ask if he was familiar with
   it. I\'m only posting this for clarification on this entire ordeal. I
   don\'t want to fight this person, I offered a relvl scroll as
   compensation. Request denied.

   You say 'Hey'
   Lost in a Forest of Kelp
   The darkness of the water combined with the countless stalks of wavy
   kelp makes it easy to lose one's way within this underwater forest. The
   kelp stalks root to the sea floor and spread out as they reach towards
   the surface. Each stalk waves in unison with the others in a rhythmic,
   almost hypnotic manner. One could easily pass right by something in the
   expansive kelp forest and never notice.
   The corpse of a ravenous viperfish is lying here.
   <LoS> Ozpin, Headmaster of Beacon Academy is standing here.
