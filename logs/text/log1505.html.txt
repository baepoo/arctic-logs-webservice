   Robillard seen grouped with Zrefe. Spare me the randoming rhetoric.

   Your victim's tracks end here.
   Cila flies in from the north.
   Between Four Trees
   Robillard Salvatore, Archmagus of the Sword Coast is standing here.
   (flying)
   . . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.

   Cila crashes into Robillard in a thundering collision, knocking him to
   the ground!

   529H 80V 227C Exits:NE(S)W> exa corpse
   It's a pretty ghastly sight! Searching through the remains, you find:

   the midnight staff
   a jagged bracer
   a beaded leather bracelet
   a beaver pelt belt
   a grey hooded cloak
   a pair of plain leather sleeves
   a pair of wolf's hide gloves
   a pair of cord sandals
   some shark skin leggings
   a grey leather mask
   a set of magi robes
   an alligator scale necklace..it glows dimly [2]
   a bone key..it glows dimly..it hums softly
   a few strands of sticky spider web
   a silver wand..it glows dimly
   a shield of bone and flesh
   a large first-aid kit
   a loaf of rye bread [2]
   a red stone
   a striated green marble staff..it hums softly
   [return for more, q to stop]exa corpse
   Cila says 'lot of crap in there'
