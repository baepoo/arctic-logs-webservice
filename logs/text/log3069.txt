   The Entrance to the Halls of Oxen
   A large rack with a variety of tools such as prongs and hammers has
   been
   nailed to the wall of the smithy. A large cooling bucket is placed
   within
   a minotaur's length of the anvil and furnace where most of the
   repairing
   of armor and weapons is taken care of. Hisses from rapidly quenched
   metal
   and rings from hammer on anvil pollute the air with noise. The master
   smith who runs this shop seems busy, churning out a steady supply of
   horseshoes, weapons, and armor, while doing repairs as well.
   The corpse of Sully is lying here.

   A Frosty Path Through Twendle
   This grassy path, etched in deep, white frost, winds its way through
   several huts. Though populated, this village is strikingly quiet and
   the
   barbaric humans that pass you seem apprehensive. Smoke drifts lazily
   by,
   carrying with it the smell of roasting lion meat. Nestled near the
   Khalkists to the north, this village would be in a very precarious
   position
   in the event of an avalanche.
   A small white die lies here.
   A wooden sign has been hammered into the ground.

   Sub flies east.
   You follow Sub east.
   You have arrived at a fen. This is merely a floating mat on the bog and
   you
   suddenly become mired in the peat.
   Sinful the imp flies in from the west.
   Mired in the Bog
   Moving quickly through the bog, your foot suddenly catches on
   something beneath the water and you plunge head first into the murky
   water
   beneath you. Attempting to pick yourself up from the mud, you find that
   you
   cannot lift your feet. They are stuck fast in the mud and try as you
   might,
   you cannot pull them free. You can feel your feet slowly sinking into
   the
   mud, pulling you deeper and deeper into the water of the bog. Soon, the
   water will be over your head and you will not be able to breathe. You
   grasp
   and struggle to pull yourself free, but it only makes you sink quicker.
   Finding no choice, you stop struggling and sit still, waiting to die.
   A crimson imp, Sinful, flaps its flame-tipped, bat-like wings rapidly.
