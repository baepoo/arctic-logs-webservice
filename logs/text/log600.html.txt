   Tormak the armourer says 'I don't trade with someone I can't see!'
   207H 102V 369183X 454C Mem:12 Exits:E> New Tarsis Forge
   A simple forge glows redly where the back of the smithy abuts the
   smokehouse to the north and a foot-driven bellows stands ready to heat
   the
   fire to white. Several barrels of liquid along the far wall gleam in
   the
   dimness. One large anvil in the center of the room focuses all activity
   around it. Hung neatly on hooks are the various hammers, tongs,
   chisels,
   and aprons necessary to the smith's trade.
   The corpse of Cyrax is lying here.
   The corpse of Ghoose is lying here.
   A waterskin lies discarded on the ground.
   Kieko the Male Gnome is standing here. (invisible)
   . . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.
   Tormak the armourer stops pumping his bellows as you approach.
