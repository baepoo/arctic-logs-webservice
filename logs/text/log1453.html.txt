   Yaz baits, jerks die.

   Yaz utters some strange words. A huge swarm of biting, stinging insects
   fills the air.

   The Pig and Whistle
   You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
   has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
   fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in
   the
   corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit
   and
   relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to
   the
   west is a meeting room.

   The Tavern Square
   Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
   races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
   peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A
   dark
   alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
   executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street
   and
   the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp
   on
   the tavern wall.

   The narrow cobbled lane leads east-west towards the main town squares.
   Old houses loom above you, casting shadows that dance and seem to
   follow

   the
   north you see an old well house, possibly the oldest building in this
   section of town.
