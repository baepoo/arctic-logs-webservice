A Narrow Road
A narrow road leads deep into a thick forest of very tall trees and
north it leads through the plains of Abanasinia. Around you are many
trees
but not as many as to the south. The road runs in the near shadows of
the
Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great
lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The
plains spread out to the north from here for many leagues.
