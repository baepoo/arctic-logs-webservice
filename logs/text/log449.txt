   Kafilat and Altraz in a happy world.

   POV: Some dude

   Log Rating: 2.4001

   Kafilat (Sheep/Hyksos) relocates and try to edrain/kill Altraz
   ocassionally. It all started when Altraz looked at Kafilat and he got
   pissed and tried to recall Altraz. Ever since then, poofing to Altraz
   had been a regular thing. Anyway, with this log, peace had been
   restored, and hopefully we can all go about living our own happy lives
   again and not randoming people and maybe respect them a little. -Sir
   Altraz Regweld
