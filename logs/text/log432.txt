   Off in the distance, you hear the sounds of an elven lute playing.
   Before a Temple
   To the west grows a gigantic circle of ancient oaks, spiraling
   together to form a tower. The tower is all solid save one spot due west
   of
   here, where two younger oaks have arched to form a doorway. The sound
   of an
   elven lute greets you as you walk westward, while the quiet chirping of
   the
   forest beckons from the east. A small patch of greenish moss grows on
   an
   oak here.

   Thoughts of splendor and earthly comfort fill your mind, putting you at

   trees, clawing at the sky.

   fern
   or two, spicing up the forested landscape. A small patch of fluorescent
   green moss grows on the side of an ancient tree, forming letters. The

   Small patches of flowers line the road, with an occasional fern or

   intersection with a smaller path leading eastward. The town feels
   exactly

   Hills could hide a village of this magnitude. Undoubtedly hundreds live
   here within plain sight, and you wonder how a village of this size has
   been
   able to stay intact with Delphon and Neraka so close. Surely any
   insurrection from this village would require a full battalion of
   draconian
   soldiers. A small cobblestone road begins here, worn and shaped by

   The familiar clatter and chirps of the wildlife fade as you travel
   further down the faded path. Small fish swim to the surface of the
   creek,
   jumping at the occasional tick or dragonfly. The creek takes an abrupt
   turn, and resumes its intermittent course. The trees appear to have
   reached
   their maximum height, formidable to most adventurers. Farther south, a

   winds its way upwards around the inside wall of the tower. It has been

   and wooden trapdoor to the topmost chamber of the tower can be seen

   The chamber of the mage of the tower is quite clean. Tables are covered

   are carved on the red walls, most looking quite old, but still powerful
   nonetheless. There is a door in the center of each of the walls, and
   they
   appear to lead into small chambers, even though your senses tell you,
   judging from the walls, that they should lead out into the mid-air.
