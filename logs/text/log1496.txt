   Market Street West
   This is the busy market street, filled with people, shops and stands.
   People from all over Krynn come to this town for trade and other
   business.
   The town square is not to far to the east through the crowd. A small
   path
   to the north will take you to the Temple of Kalaman, while to the south
   you
   see a small building with a sign above the door.

   The town square is not to far to the east through the crowd. Some other
   notable sites are the Temple of Kalaman, which is just to the north of
   Market Street, and Lord Calof's mansion to the south. Directly to the
   south, you see a magic shop of strange and interesting artifacts.

   Market Square of Kalaman
   This square is the busiest part of the city. People of all kinds walk
   the city square of Kalaman. Shoppers, merchants and wagons go through
   this
   square non-stop all day long. The air is filled with the smell of food,
   spice and anything else you can think of. It is almost impossible to
   stretch your arms here without hitting something or someone.

   through Kalaman. Just to the north, you see the busy city square and

   you see the Traveler's Lodge, where most visitors to Kalaman stay.
