   POV: Silage

   Log Rating: 2.0834

   I die for the last time to RevoClan, being promised peace minutes
   later.

   The Master Bedroom
   This room is empty of the sense of death and decay that has so over-
   whelmed the rest of the farm. The air seems much clearer here, but the
   sense of evil and malice seems even more pronounced. The room has been
   virtually untouched. The furniture has not been broken and the room
   ransacked like the rest of the house.
   The corpse of the succubus is lying here.
   Krovax, the Ancient Darkness is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
   Tokin Stachnik, Stoking the Bonfire is standing here. (flying)
   (invisible)
   . . . has a tough exterior.
   163H 119V 4056211X 1067C Mem:1 Exits:NW>
   Tokin focuses harshly on you and utters some strange words.
   Your limbs freeze in place!
   163H 119V 4056211X 1067C Mem:1 Exits:NW>
   Suddenly someone stabs you in the back with a blade of darkness, RIP...
   You're dead.
   -11H 119V 4056211X 1067C Mem:1 Exits:NW> You regain control of your
   body.
   You feel yourself exposed.
   You throw away your bloody bandages.
   Your skin softens.
   Your detect invisibility wears off.
   The ball of light following you winks out.
   You LOSE a level! You hide your head in shame.
   You stop following someone.
