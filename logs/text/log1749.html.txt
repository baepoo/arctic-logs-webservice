   Crossing the Foothills
   You are traveling through the foothills, below the mountains to your
   north. The path you are on is quite wide, and as you look closer
   beneath
   you, you can make out numerous wagon and horse tracks in the dirt path.
   The
   path heads north towards the mountains, or continues through the rugged
   foothills to the south.
   A greasy young boy tried to steal something from you!

   Crossing the Foothills
   You are traveling through the foothills, below the mountains off to
   your north. This path has obviously been well used, and must weave its
   way
   past many interesting points. The path continues to the south towards a
   junction of several paths, and to the north into the foothills.

   A Split of Paths
   You have arrived at a split in the path here. The large path continues
   to the north into the foothills, and to the west out of the badlands.
   Branching off to the east you can also make out a smaller path which
   bends
   quickly to the north and out of your sight.
   A wooden signpost is staked into the ground here.

   Ascending the Mountainous Slope
   You stand on a small path in the middle of the mountain slope. Suddenly
   you hear a branch snap behind you, and quickly spin around to see the
   source of the noise, only to notice nothing unusual. The eerie
   surroundings
   must be playing tricks with your mind. The path leads off to the north
   towards a massive tower. Meanwhile off to your west the path exits down
   the
   mountain and joins up with a large path.
   A dragonarmy scout patrols the region.
