You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in
the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit
and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to
the
west is a meeting room.
A medallion of the great goddess Mishakal lies forgotten in the
dirt...it glows dimly
The Tavern owner, William Sweetwater, offers you a drink and a pie.
396H 110V 1986920X 87C Exits:NWU> nThe Tavern Square
Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A
dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street
and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp
on
the tavern wall.

A Cobbled Lane
The narrow cobbled lane leads east-west towards the main town squares.
Old houses loom above you, casting shadows that dance and seem to
follow
your movements. The occasional rat scurries away in your presence. To
the
north you see an old well house, possibly the oldest building in this
section of town.
A delicious loaf of bread rests upon the ground. [12]

Traders Square
This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from
wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going
distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead
away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

Latifa flies north.
You follow Latifa north.
Elven Arch
A breeze, carrying the scent of wildflowers, washes gently over you,
and departs with the quietest of whispers. Overhead, the white clouds
mold
and twist themselves, splashing against the shores of heavens unseen.
The
azure sky, peeking carefully between frothy, white lumps, begins to
show
the first signs of night as darkness begins to pull itself across the
horizon. Retreating, the sun offers the land its warmth, beams of gold
slicing through the cool air. Ahead, the forest begins to pull
together,
trees crowding against each other, and vines twisting about the
moss-covered trunks, creating a wall of vegetation. Strangely, it seems
that some of the forest has become interlaced into a poetic arch,
crossing
the space just above you. Through this arch, the trail continues to the
north.
Grauth is standing here. (flying)

You follow Latifa north.
Northern Path
The forest presses inward, pushing and shoving at the small, dirty
trail. Ancient trees line the path, reaching out and digging their hard
roots, like tentacles, into the muddy forest floor. The uneasy roar of
silence overwhelms the sweet chirpings of a Thrush, and pushes its way
through the forest undergrowth, rushing over your feet like tiny waves.
Breathing in the humid air, a sensation of drowning overcomes you,
broken
only by the occasional cool breeze from the south.

Forest Path
Vines like great serpents hang precariously from the lower branches of
the trees. Coiling and squeezing, the thin, green ropes have woven
themselves into a natural tapestry. A thick, chaotic knot, this forest
curtain separates the civilized from the wild. Brushing aside the
numerous
strands, trying to peer into the forest's inner depths, one can only
see
the shifting of shadows as the angle of natural light is altered.

You follow Latifa north.
Natural Net
A fine mist, tiny droplets of rainwater, shuffle to the earth, and run
down the trunks of the trees in tiny rivulets. Placing your hand upon
the
wet bark, you can feel warmth spewing out of the wood and into your
fingers. Distant, deep within the core of the wood, a steady, rhythmic
beat
vibrates throughout these wooden pillars. Alive and muttering its tales
into the wind, the pulse of these great, wooden giants seems to lead
the
forest in a strange primeval dance yet to be understood.
