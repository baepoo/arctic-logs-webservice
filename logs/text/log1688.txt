   Guardian Chamber
   This room, like its three companions, is spartan to the point of
   bareness. The walls are plain and undecorated, the floor is covered
   with a
   fine layer of dirt to serve as a carpet of sorts, and there are only
   two
   torches in the room to illuminate it. The wooden furniture looks almost
   as
   thought it is about to fall apart, which doesn't really surprise you.
   As
   you turn to leave, you notice a cloud and a small owl chiseled above
   the
   door. There appears to be a small lever built into the south wall.
   Mlia the Male Human is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
   . . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.
   A guardian wrapped in blue robes is shadow boxing here.
   A guardian wrapped in blue robes is stretching against the wall here.

   Corner of the Celestial Temple
   The Celestial Temple comes to a corner here, proceeding off to the
   northeast and northwest and disappearing into the valley walls. The
   temple
   looks to be symmetrical down both edges, but you can see no traces of
   an
   entrance. There are obvious signs of the Celestial War marring the
   otherwise pristine walls of the temple, but no breaks that would
   indicate a
   way in. In a sudden rush of fear, it occurs to you that the entrance
   might
   be locked forever underneath the rock which covers the rest of the
   temple.
   There appears to be the outline of a door here, but you can't be sure.

   Near a Large Pit
   Although the broken and rusted piece of equipment scattered here draw
   your attention immediately, your mind eventually focuses on the large
   pit
   immediately to the south. It takes up most of the area to the south and
   prevents you from moving in that direction. Glancing over the edge of
   the
   pit, you see a collection of sharp spear point up at you from three
   meters
   below. Given the bits of canvas and dried leaves littering the bottom
   of
   the pit, this was obviously once used as a trap, though which side
   constructed it is anybody's guess.
