   Passage Near the Tower
   The sound of your heavy footsteps greets your ears with a deafening
   roar as you walk through the small confines of the passageway between
   the
   courtyards. The nearby presence of the outer curtain wall and the tower
   itself make this area seem almost prison like. Shaking off the sudden
   feeling of claustrophobia, you turn your attention to the heavy steel
   door
   to your east which appears to provide entrance to the tower. The
   passageway
   continues to your north and to your south exits into a secluded and
   dark
   corner.

   Guard Room
   You stand in the center of a large guard room, capable of holding up to
   fifty knights in times of war. Looking up above you, you notice that
   there
   appears to be no discernible ceiling to the room you are standing in.
   Pondering this prospect, you realize that the outer portion of the
   tower is
   hollow and stretches clear to the top of the tower itself. An iron door
   is
   west of here, and a passage to the north leads deeper into the Tower.
