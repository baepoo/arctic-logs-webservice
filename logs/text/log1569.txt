   A Cobbled Lane
   The lane leads north-south, into the quiet and strange town. There is a
   small sign here, making you aware of the inn nearby. To the east lies
   the
   only stretch of greenery in Neraka - once. What was obviously a small
   park
   has been ruthlessly burnt, signs of campfires and tent markings suggest
   that a draconian camp has once been here.

   Before the Northern Gate of Neraka
   The dark city of Neraka spreads out to the south, the dark minions of
   Takhisis filling the streets. A twisted dark spire rises in the middle
   of
   the city, the pinnacle of the Queen's temple. The craggy peaks of the
   Khalkist mountains rise around the city, adding their shadows to the
   film
   of ash that floats through the air.
