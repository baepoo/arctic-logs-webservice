On a Small Path
Looking to the northwest, the path can be seen to lead towards a small
wood and the hills that lie beyond, winding its way up and down the
green
slopes. The immediate path leads to the west, while to the east is a
crossroad.

A Road in the Hills
This rough road winds its way through foothills near the Khalkist
Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east
and
northeast. These hills are green, dotted by the occasional dark grey
boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no
wagon
ruts on this rugged road.

To the west is a small pond, filled with cool water and interesting
plants. The path turns to the north, first leading to the pond so that
you
may take a relaxing bath if you wish. There are plenty of trees and
thornbushes here to dry your wet clothes if that is what you wish. The
path
continues to the north where the vegetation becomes denser.
