Tourney Round 1

POV: Natya

Log Rating: -2.5000

Natya brings on the tricks, traps, and most definitely pain upon
everyone else. Note Halibio and Cruise cheating to get back into
tourney after death!

With every step you take through these abandoned tunnels, the bottoms
of your leg become thoroughly soaked, as your footsteps kick up the
foul
pools of water underfoot. The tunnels are large enough for a trio of
ogres
to walk upright, shoulder to shoulder, and the ceiling above you is
shrouded by darkness. The poignant stench of mildew emanates from the
wet
dungeon walls, and you find yourself wishing to be out of this maze of
darkness.

You find yourself in the middle of a large four way intersection of
very large tunnels, which you hope are abandoned. Darkness branches off
in
every direction, and you are unable to make out the tunnels end. The
poignant stench of mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls, and the
floor is covered with foul pools of brackish water. Directly above you,
is
a small ladder which reaches up towards the base of a large stone
structure.
