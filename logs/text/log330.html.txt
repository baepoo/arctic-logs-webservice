   The Head Cleric's Sanctum
   The sanctum is very spacious, and almost devoid of any furniture. A
   large altar and kneeling mat dominate the far wall. A feeling of
   cleanliness washes over you.

   This hall is full of life. Vegetation has been allowed to grow in the
   corners and on the far walls. The area is teeming with life, some plant
   some animal. No attempt has been made to evict any of the hall's
   inhabitants, and several smug-looking rats casually play on the floor.
