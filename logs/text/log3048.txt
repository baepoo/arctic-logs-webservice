A Waiting Room
A large central table occupies most of the room with eight chairs
surrounding it. Both the table and chairs are made of silver, the
table with a thick etched glass top. At the center of the table are
an assortment of bowls with fruits, dried meats, glasses of wine,
mugs of ale, and several stacked serving dishes, a wide range of
treats for entertaining a wide array of guests. The walls of the room
are smooth white plaster with colorful framed paintings hanging from
them depicting the sun setting on a wide range of places from
Palanthas to Tarsis. On the southern wall is an arched doorway framed
in polished black marble, the only exit from the room.
