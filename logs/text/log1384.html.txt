   Market Street West
   This is the busy market street, filled with people, shops and stands.
   People from all over Krynn come to this town for trade and other
   business.
   The town square is not to far to the east through the crowd. A small
   path
   to the north will take you to the Temple of Kalaman, while to the south
   you
   see a small building with a sign above the door.

   Entrance to the School
   The building is not very large and looks quite humble. The master of
   this school is an elven maiden; rumors have it she is a great
   enchantress.
   But because of the mages' esoteric nature, people really aren't
   certain.
   Noel the Male High Elf is standing here.

   You see nothing special about him.
   Noel the elder male high elf is in an excellent condition.

   <worn around neck> a ragged fur cloak
   <worn on body> a furry white cloak

   Sorcerer's Lounge
   This lounge area looks almost like a library. Bookshelves line all
   four walls of this room. Many young mages spend their breaks here
   studying.
   A set of creaky wooden steps lead up into a large classroom.
