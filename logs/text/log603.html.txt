   You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
   has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
   fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in
   the
   corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit
   and
   relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to
   the
   west is a meeting room.
