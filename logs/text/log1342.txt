through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to
form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and
hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at
the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.
