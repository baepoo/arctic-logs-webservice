The Gladiator's Arena
Encircled by stone walls that hold up the seating area for the throngs
of spectators present, the large sandy pit that is the arena appears
baked
from the hot Krynnish sun. The distinct scent of bodily fluids,
including
blood, invades the sweaty atmosphere. Though the dusty floor would make
a
soothing sound as it swirls around in the rare breeze, the deafening
roars
of the bloodthirsty crowd drown it out. The lack of an entrance or exit
proves the only escape to be deadly, mortal combat.
Terrified, you suddenly appear in the arena.
