   The North Gate of Port Balifor
   Tired and weary, you drag your aching feet along the narrow road that
   passes through the north gate of Balifor. A tall city wall surrounds
   the
   port on its three open sides, an indication of its trading wealth and
   prosperous people. The sea off Balifor is reputedly vicious for the
   inexperienced, defending the town well.
   A bored watchman guards the northern gates of Balifor.

   Before the Gates of Balifor
   This long and dusty road ends south at the port of Balifor, a busy
   trading centre for Krynn. All travellers are welcome in Port Balifor
   but
   one must remain wary of the constant flow of smugglers and thieves that
   call this town home. Known for its bawdy taverns, black markets and
   expansive slums, Balifor is not home for the meek.

   Road to Port Balifor
   Dry, yellow, parched grasses expand all around you. Hot winds goad the
   few trees that brave the heat of the relentless summer suns, and
   several
   travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
   sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south. The saline smell of the sea
   is
   slight in the air, hardly noticeable, though it is obvious that the
   glittering, placid waters of the Khurman Sea are not far off. Curving
   north
   and west, the dusty road continues along the rolling plains.
   A hickory walking stick rests here, forgotten.

   On a Coastside Road
   This road follows the coast of the Khurman Sea. A glittering expanse of
   blue water lies west of the road. The saline smell of saltwater hangs
   thinly in the air, quickly dispelled by the frequent warm winds rolling
   down from the Khuri-Khan and Ek-Khan far east of here. The cool breeze
   from
   the sea meets the winds of the hills here in a mild, gusty breeze that
   sways the few trees that manage to grow along this road. To the north
   you
   see a crossroads, while south of here the road follows the sea to Port
   Balifor.

   Road Along the Coast
   Cutting a jagged path along the grassy fields near the sea, this road
   follows the coast of the Khurman Sea. The air is filled with the crying
   of
   seagulls and the thick, saline smell of saltwater. It is well traveled
   by
   merchants and sailors, as well as the occasional band of thieves.

   A Road to the Coast
   The coast of the Khurman Sea is just south of this well-travelled road.
   The road slowly bends, wide enough so that many wagons can pass by each
   other. The sounds of waves crashing and gulls crying drifts in on a dry
   breeze from the southwest, and the air is filled with the saline smell
   of
   saltwater. The occasional fisherman drifts idly by, and the sea is
   usually
   peaceful.

   Intersection of Alan Ak-Khan
   Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are
   usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down.
   This
   crossroads is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and
   merchants
   alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits
   on
   the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
   Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no
   wonder
   that bandits frequent these roads.
