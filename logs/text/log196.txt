   Hazar looks at you.

   Hazar thrusts a runed knife of crimson adamantite into your back.
   That Really did HURT!
   You feel a sharp pain in your chest, as Hazar's knife breaks skin,

   north
   You're not fighting, why bother fleeing?
   168H 106V 3390242X 856C Exits:NS> Hazar makes a strange sound, as you
   place a wickedly barbed sho
   rt sword in his back.
   168H 106V 3390242X 856C [Me:Bad] [Hazar:Fair] Exits:NS>

   Hazar panics, and attempts to flee.
   Hazar flies south.
   168H 106V 3390242X 856C Exits:NS>
   Suddenly Hazar stabs you in the back.
   That Really did HURT!
