   After battle in Xak, one evil couldn't hide...

   The Seeker's Inn
   A fire blazes in a large stone fireplace in the northern corner of
   the room. Several tables are scattered around, and several occupants of
   the inn are seated at the tables, ordering food and drink from the
   roving
   waitresses. A bard sits by the fireplace, a lute slung over one
   shoulder.
   The innkeeper smiles as you enter, and motions you to come closer so as
   to hear above the loud merrymaking of the inn.
   A pile of worn maps sits in the corner, free to adventurers.
