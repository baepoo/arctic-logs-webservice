The Reception
This is the reception of the lodge, where you would sign in for a
room. This is also a very popular place where adventurers sit around
and
share tales of their journeys. Some stairs in the back lead up to the
quarters.
A small badge lies on the ground, collecting dust.
A wooden bulletin board with the heading 'Wanted' is posted on the
wall.
Brukal the Clan Destroyer is resting here.
Ferynic the Male Wild Elf is resting here.
The manager of Traveler's Lodge stands here ready to sign you in.
A tall and strong bouncer, hired to protect the lodge's customers,
stands here.

Brukal makes a strange sound but is suddenly very silent, as you place
a dagger in his back.
You receive 0 experience.
Brukal is dead! R.I.P.
