   A Warm Cave
   The air is pleasantly warm here though it does smell in a large degree
   like a camp fire. There are bits of burnt wood lying around in the
   chamber
   and every now and then on the wall you can see large claw marks as if
   something tried to rend a hole through the wall.

   Red Dragon's Lair
   The walls of the chamber are pitch black as is most of the floor of
   this large underground chamber. You can see a large number of prize
   artifacts from years gone by lying upon the ground. Many of them are
   now
   worthless as they have been too deeply damaged by the years. You can
   see
   that the occupant of this room was recently here as embers still burn
   in
   two braziers near the north wall. There is a large statue of an ancient
   warrior standing in the middle of the room, a large black mace firmly
   embedded within his hands.
   A small campfire fills the area with a warm, comfortable glow.

   525H 72V 11513189X 1624C Exits:N> Red Dragon's Lair
   The walls of the chamber are pitch black as is most of the floor of
   this large underground chamber. You can see a large number of prize
   artifacts from years gone by lying upon the ground. Many of them are
   now
   worthless as they have been too deeply damaged by the years. You can
   see
   that the occupant of this room was recently here as embers still burn
   in
   two braziers near the north wall. There is a large statue of an ancient
   warrior standing in the middle of the room, a large black mace firmly
   embedded within his hands.
   The corpse of Rath is lying here.
   A small campfire fills the area with a warm, comfortable glow.
   The corpse of Gruarth, the ancient red dragon is lying here.
   Sonni the Male Hylar Dwarf is SITTING here. (flying)
   A large bearded warrior stands here, mace held in an ancient grasp.

   A Warm Cave
   The air is pleasantly warm here though it does smell in a large degree
   like a camp fire. There are bits of burnt wood lying around in the
   chamber
   and every now and then on the wall you can see large claw marks as if
   something tried to rend a hole through the wall.
