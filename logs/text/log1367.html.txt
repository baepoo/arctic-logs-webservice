   Surrounded by an Arid Desert
   Sloping dunes of sand sweep around you, completely dominating the
   scenery. Not much can be seen here, but every once in a while you
   notice
   thin, spidery pockets of sand drawn up towards the sky in the buffeting
   winds. Here you can almost smell somthing different in the air, perhaps
   bordering between freshly killed food, and the old stench of death.

   You are now most definitely approaching a settlement of some type.
   The sounds and smells of the living pervade your senses in this
   desolate
   land of sand. You can almost make out its beginnings nearby to the
   east,
   despite the hazy projection of the heat and the stinging sweat filling
   your eyes.

   Entrance to the Settlement
   It is now apparent that you are at the entrance to the Brog
   settlement. Large domes are scattered about, their strange shape make
   you
   feel only more alien to the strange landscape. A roughly hewn path
   winds
   between the crudely fashioned huts. One such hut, looking no different
   than the dozens of others in the settlement, lies to your north. The
   trail
   turns to your south towards more huts.

   sand, obscuring the desolate scenery from your vision. You can see a
   few
   Brog milling about the settlement here. The path begins to look a bit
   more
   intentional here. It takes a turn to the east from the north, but not
   before it comes to a small hut to the south.

   You are now nearing what seems to be the center of the Brog camp. You
   can spot little broglings scuttling about with their parents frequently
   here, throwing long, curious gazes your way. Their parents, on the
   other
   hand, take no interest in you and give you nothing more than a hard,
   cold
   stare. Often you spot the majority of the Brog ducking behind various
   huts
   and structures to avoid your gaze, lest they become the next of your
   victims.

   A Family Hut
   A large Brog family seems to inhabit this hut. The filth is
   overwhelming. It seems that the Brog are not bothered by the stench,
   nor
   do they condemn it. The large dome covering that serves as the walls of
   this hut is oval, longways from east to west. There is an opening to
   the
   north that appears to lead to an unfinished room. A large, clay table
   sits
   here, obviously being the place where the familiy has its meals.
   A useless leather scabbard has been thrown on the ground.

   The Center of the Settlement
   As far as town centers go, you are fairly sure that this is not the
   fanciest of them. A very deep, crude well has been constructed here so
   that the inhabitants of the settlement might find some form of
   survival.
   In addition, you also spot a few crude decorations around the well, and
   a
   couple of large rocks for the creatures to sit upon. You can see paths
   leading in all directions, except towards the east. There you can see a
   strangely decorated hut, set separately from the rest.
