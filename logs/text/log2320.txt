rare, perhaps smuggled in from the rest of the continent. There is a

Entrance to the Government Building
A large and busy hall greets you as you walk in. There are people and
draconians running around, running tasks for whomever is in charge.
Most
of the people don't pay attention to you, thinking you are only
mercenaries
that have come to cast your lot with the armies of the Dark Queen. The
draconians, on the other hand, stare at you with contempt and hatred.
There are two doors leading east and west. Near the southern end of the
hall, there is a small, spiral staircase that leads up. Though this
building was once used as a city hall, it has been converted to the
headquarters of the Highlord's rear flank.

The current mayor of Lemish is a draconian, whose disguise as the
previous
mayor fooled the citizenry into allowing the dragonarmies easy access
to
the city. It is apparent from looking at him that the disguise is no
longer
needed; his reptilian features can easily be seen. He glowers at you
from
bulging black eyes, quickly deciding if you are a potential ally, or a
foe
to be reckoned with.
The draconian mayor has a few scratches.
