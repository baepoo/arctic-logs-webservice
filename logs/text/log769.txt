A Path In The Mountains
The path leads higher up in to the mountains away from civilization.
The summit is still completely obscured by fog but the wind seems to be
growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is
none
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the
remote
location of the mountain. Despite the wind there is an eerie stillness
that
seems to hint at lurking danger.

A Path In The Mountains
The path leads higher up in to the mountains away from civilization.
The summit is still completely obscured by fog but the wind seems to be
growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is
none
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the
remote
location of the mountain. Despite the wind there is an eerie stillness
that
seems to hint at lurking danger.

A Path In The Mountains
The path leads higher up in to the mountains away from civilization.
The summit is still completely obscured by fog but the wind seems to be
growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is
none
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the
remote
location of the mountain. Despite the wind there is an eerie stillness
that
seems to hint at lurking danger.

growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is

A Path Around A Mountain
The path seems to run around the base of the ancient mountain. No life
can be seen anywhere, it is as if all that was living simply vanished.
The
path seems well kept but there is little to no wear. Fierce winds gust
from
every direction, making the mountain even more formidable. A dense fog
hangs over the top of the mountain preventing a better view of the
mountain.

The path continues around the backside of the mountain but the east

which seems to hang over the peak. Fierce winds howl throughout the
mountain giving it a greater sense of foreboding. There is no life

the
lines of the living for quite some time.

growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is

existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the

that
seems to hint at lurking danger.

The path leads higher up in to the mountains away from civilization.
The summit is still completely obscured by fog but the wind seems to be
growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is
none
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the
remote
location of the mountain. Despite the wind there is an eerie stillness
that
seems to hint at lurking danger.

The summit is still completely obscured by fog but the wind seems to be
growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is
none
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the
remote
location of the mountain. Despite the wind there is an eerie stillness
that
seems to hint at lurking danger.

Nearing The Top of the Mountain
The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this
distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and
the
biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life
anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that
of
the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to
lead
around the peak of the mountain but it's difficult to ascertain where
exactly one is in relation to the lower regions of the mountain.

The bleak looking mountain shoots up into the air, seeming to pierce
the sky. It is difficult to see the top of the mountain due to the haze
that seems to be hanging around the mountain. Fierce winds blow causing

this

The bleak looking mountain shoots up into the air, seeming to pierce

this

Nearing The Top of the Mountain
The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this
distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and
the
biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life
anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that
of
the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to
lead
around the peak of the mountain but it's difficult to ascertain where
exactly one is in relation to the lower regions of the mountain.

A Path Around A Mountain
The bleak looking mountain shoots up into the air, seeming to pierce
the sky. It is difficult to see the top of the mountain due to the haze
that seems to be hanging around the mountain. Fierce winds blow causing

this
place is dead to the world and seems to not to have seen the living in

obviously
one should tread lightly.

that seems to be hanging around the mountain. Fierce winds blow causing

this
place is dead to the world and seems to not to have seen the living in

obviously
one should tread lightly.

The summit of the mountain would provide a spectacular view of the

it.
The wind blows harder here than anywhere else, its strength is enough
to
chill any living creature to the bone. The only sign of life which
exists
is a small tent which is miraculously set up atop this peak. A small
tunnel
seems to run down the center of the mountain, and turning around, you

A Path Around A Mountain
The path seems to run around the base of the ancient mountain. No life
can be seen anywhere, it is as if all that was living simply vanished.
The
path seems well kept but there is little to no wear. Fierce winds gust
from
every direction, making the mountain even more formidable. A dense fog
hangs over the top of the mountain preventing a better view of the
mountain.
A yellowish, green haze fills the air of the room. [2]

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this

A Path Around A Mountain
The path seems to run around the base of the ancient mountain. No life
can be seen anywhere, it is as if all that was living simply vanished.
The
path seems well kept but there is little to no wear. Fierce winds gust
from
every direction, making the mountain even more formidable. A dense fog
hangs over the top of the mountain preventing a better view of the
mountain.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

The Barren Wastes
The desert is incredibly barren and gives off the scent of death at
every turn. Sand is everywhere and makes the desert seem endless. It is
impossible to get a bearing on where the desert starts and stops due to
the
endless dunes in all directions. The unbearable heat is exacerbated by
the
stale air and the lack of a breeze.

By the Oasis
To the west there appears to an oasis, which seems odd given the bleak
nature of the desert. Signs of life can be seen in this area, which is
in
stark contrast to the rest of the desert. The heat is not as
intolerable as
in other parts of the desert although it is hardly comfortable.

Lost Inside A Brackish Swamp
Having stumbled into this foul swamp, you find yourself without ant
bearings. No sunlight Penetrates the thick canopy of trees which
creates a
ceiling above your head. No air circulates through this dismal area,
and
every step causes you to sink a little bit more into the water which
stagnates around you.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted

A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the

cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.

their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

Tarsis
wastelands to the west.

A massive, charred crater is all that remains of the southeastern part

Northern Road
The city square lies just to the south, where the sounds of children
laughing and other familiar city sounds filled the air. Now there is an
eery silence, save for the noises that you make. This road runs
north-south, joining the cities fountain with the it's northern gate,

a narrow street leads east, towards the remains of an important looking

Old Tarsis Square
Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken
shell
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are
shattered
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the
city.

plagued you starts to fade. Your feet squelch as you leave the muck and

the scrub brush. The ocean stretches on for miles and miles in front of
you, and the wind whispers sweet nothings as it stirs across the dunes
and
kicks up sand. You notice that there is a small tent set up atop the
dunes,
as well as what appears to be a thin layer of grass, which covers a
hole
leading down into the heart of the dune itself.

green and fertile patch of land. Animals of all sorts gather around the
oasis to drink and make merry. The desert is alive with the sound of
music,
which emanates from a small cluster of tents set up along the north
side of
the lake. Bubbles occasionally burst from the water, as if escaping
from
