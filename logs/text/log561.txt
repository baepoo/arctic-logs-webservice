   You disappear in a puff of smoke!
   The Edge of the Training Grounds
   Sprawling out before you is a massive underground training facility,
   broken weapons lie scattered about and the walls are scarred with deep
   cuts
   and cracks. Further to the east you can make out another room set
   within
   the center of the grounds, and on the northern side a few makeshift
   walls
   and tanned leather hides corner off what looks like a medical facility.
   The
   smell of fresh blood invades your nose, surging from east to west in a
   putrid breeze. Northwest of you the massive base of a black tower
   shoots up
   through the ceiling.
   A new recruit of the dragonarmy is here practicing swordplay with her
   peers.
   A draconian trainee looks around for a sparring partner.

   The Edge of the Training Grounds
   Broken sword hilts and blades lie scattered around the floor here, the
   by-product of trainees that haven't yet learned the techniques of
   fighting.
   The wooden boards of the northern wall are rutted through with gaping
   slashes and splintered dents, as are the low hanging beams of the
   ceiling.
   From here the grounds continue on to the east, where a stairwell leads
   to
   another floor, and toward the south you can access the rest of the
   facility. Curving to meet the wooden wall to the west is the base of an
   ominous tower, built of smooth glass-like obsidian.
   A draconian trainee looks around for a sparring partner.
   Elyana Lipetskaya, BSD Minister of Peace is standing here. (flying)
