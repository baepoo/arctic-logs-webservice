   Solace Square
   Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
   huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
   their
   limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
   clearing
   here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
   spot
   in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
   north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
   huge
   vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
   small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
   the
   thick limbs which house the buildings.

   On a Vallenwood Tree Above Solace Square
   The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
   both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the
   boughs,
   some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures
   have
   not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its
   charm.
   A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a
   neighboring
   vallenwood tree.

   On a Vallenwood Bough
   The bough of this vallenwood tree is wide enough to allow ten people to
   walk across side by side. You notice a small temple to the east with
   scores
   of people moving in and out, heads bowed. to the west, devout knights
   seek
   solace and divine intervention in a shrine built into a branch. To the
   south the bough climbs upward at forty-five degrees, but footholds and
   handholds allow for easy progress upwards.

   The Temple of Healing Arts
   You are stunned by the beauty and majesty of this temple. How it was
   built, in such a small room, is beyond your comprehension. High vaulted
   ceilings rise where you would expect to see the thick branches of the
   vallenwood. You see a large ivory altar and fall in line with the many
   adventurers awaiting their turn to worship. A small door leads west.
   Lady Camilla walks around gracefully as she blesses the congregation.

   On a Canopy Walk Between Two Vallenwood Trees
   The canopy walk is constructed using durable vines and vallenwood
   planks. Here it stretches across two huge vallenwood trees bridging
   them.
   Inhabitants of Solace regularly walk in the canopy, since it is much
   safer. It is a good distance to solid ground below and those with a
   fear
   of heights will likely find themselves holding on to the vines with all
   their might.
