The Muddy Waters
This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served
by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering
hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most
of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.
Aldur A'Kul the master thief sits in a corner watching every movement.

On a Vallenwood Bough
The sturdy bough leads north and south. To the west, thick foliage from
the vallenwood tree hides whatever lies there giving you a sense of
dark
foreboding. To the east, a small rickety hut is built on the branch of
the
vallenwood tree.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly
A fidgeting wiry young boy stands here looking suspicious.
An old beggar hobbles along here looking for handouts.

On a Vallenwood Tree Above Solace Square
The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the
boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures
have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its
charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a
neighboring
vallenwood tree.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly
A Solace peacekeeper stands here, holding the peace.

Solace Square
Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly
A silver key lies here.
A crudely carved oaken staff topped with a stone point lies here.
A bright pile of cloth lies on the ground.
A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.
