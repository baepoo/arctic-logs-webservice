   You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
   has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
   fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in
   the
   corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit
   and
   relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to
   the
   west is a meeting room.

   Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
   races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
   peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A
   dark
   alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
   executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street
   and
   the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp
   on
   the tavern wall.
   A small and weak looking horse is here awaiting its master.

   This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
   banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from
   wooden
   stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
   sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going
   distort
   your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead
   away
   from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
   cobbled square.
