   A Cobbled Lane
   The narrow cobbled lane leads east-west towards the main town squares.
   Old houses loom above you, casting shadows that dance and seem to
   follow
   your movements. The occasional rat scurries away in your presence. To
   the
   north you see an old well house, possibly the oldest building in this
   section of town.

   Traders Square
   This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
   banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from
   wooden
   stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
   sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going
   distort
   your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead
   away
   from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
   cobbled square.
   A well preserved humanoid skull stares at you with empty sockets.
   A coin has been left here.
   Delvar the Male Human is standing here. (white aura)
   . . . has a metallic luster.
   A young kender stands here, looking about curiously.
   373H 165V 1X 3460C Exits:NESW> Delvar makes a strange sound but is
   suddenly very silent, as you place a jagged-backed curved
   dagger in his back.
