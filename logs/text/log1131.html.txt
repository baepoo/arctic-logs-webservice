   Asked to kill this guy so i did!

   On a Long Road
   The long road stretches before you, wide and flat. To the south it
   becomes open and dusty, while to the north large vallenwood trees make
   up
   the tree village of Solace.
   A translucent being hovers in the air here. (invisible)
   Alkil Kiavulours, Disciple of the Elements is standing here. (flying)
   . . . has a tough exterior.
   A bandit is here, preying on helpless travellers.
   Alkil notices the bandit eyeing his possessions.

   short sword in his back.

   You can't do that while fighting.

   Various animals and insects inspect you as you wearily tread this rocky
   and dusty road. Bushes to the side provide ample cover for man or beast
   and
   it would be wise to carefully watch your possessions. The road
   continues in
   a north-south direction.
   Longuriel the Male Wild Elf is resting here.

   Alkil panics, and attempts to flee.
   Alkil flies north.

   On a Long Road
   The dense forest around you occasionally places obstacles in your path,
   you cannot help but trip and fall. Fortunately the soft cushion of dead
   leaves offers much help. Weak sounds of the hustle and bustle of town
   life
   can be heard from the north. The road continues to the south, it seems
   as
   if it could go on forever.

   The Road to Solace
   The trees that line the route give a good indication of the ways to
   travel. To the north the huge vallenwood trees of Solace are visible,
   clearly marking the southern entrance to the town. The road to the
   south
   becomes wild and rocky as it leads through a wilder section of forest.

   The Southern Gate
   This gate protects Solace from invaders from the south. Two huge
   vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and the gate is placed
   between
   these. The forest to the south looks much wilder and dangerous than the
   forest that houses Solace. Southern Avenue leads north into Solace
   itself.
   A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly
   A large notice demanding your attention is posted on the city gates.
   Alkil Kiavulours, Disciple of the Elements is standing here. (flying)
   . . . has a tough exterior.
   Sir Kantar uth MacKan walks slowly by, apparently noticing everything.
   A Solace peacekeeper stands here, vigilantly guarding the town gates.
