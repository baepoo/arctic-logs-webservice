   A Maze of Ivy
   The ivy and vines have grown so thorny and thick that they form high
   impenetrable walls, but at the same time, invite adventurers in. The
   path
   is wide and accomodating, so that there is little danger of pricking
   one's
   self on the thorns with some caution. The very vines seem to writhe and
   whip within the walls, making direct attack on the barriers seem like a
   bad
   idea indeed. The maze seems to carry on forever, looking down the
   portals,
   which open to the north, west, and south.
