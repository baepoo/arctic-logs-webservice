A Road to the Coast
The coast of the Khurman Sea is just south of this well-travelled road.
The road slowly bends, wide enough so that many wagons can pass by each
other. The sounds of waves crashing and gulls crying drifts in on a dry
breeze from the southwest, and the air is filled with the saline smell
of
saltwater. The occasional fisherman drifts idly by, and the sea is
usually
peaceful.

Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are
usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down.
This
crossroads is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and
merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits
on
the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no
wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.
