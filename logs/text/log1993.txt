   The main tunnel of Deep Mine reaches an intersection here. A large sign
   on the northern wall labels the intersection with a large number five.
   Deep
   treads in the ground act as tracks for mining carts. The tracks go in
   all
   directions of the tunnel, however the path to the east seems slightly
   more
   used by mining carts. Hanging heavy lanterns, which give off a pretty
   orange flame, light the intersection.
