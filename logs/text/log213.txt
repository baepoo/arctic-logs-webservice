   Padme panics

   POV: Padme

   Log Rating: 2.5441

   Just logged on irc and heard them ask for my assistance. Was rented in
   Tarsis earlier so I could cut off any group trying to hide in Gargs and
   it worked. Only problem was, the group was totally different from
   expected, thus I paniced and sucked hard.

   Terrible information from my irc. I got back home and just logged on
   before my dear russian friend Mavlad, told me to log and hunt.
   I excepted a small group consisting of Givi, Hanhei, Artaletta and
   Napas. Rented in Tarsis so I could travel to Gargaths first and
   prevent them from hiding, it worked. Only problem was, the group was
   somewhat different and I admit I panicked.
