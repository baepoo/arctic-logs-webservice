   The Arena of Champions
   The arena floor is a mind-boggling sight. The landscape changes
   drastically from marshes and swamps to jungles and deserts, a forest
   turns
   to tundra and is suddenly a mountain just a few steps later. There is
   no
   time to try and figure out the mystery of how such a place has come to
   exist, however, because to be in this place is to know that there are
   others here now and that the tournament is underway.
   A small campfire fills the area with a warm, comfortable glow.
   A clay golem, Achin, stands here, its hulking mass rippling.
