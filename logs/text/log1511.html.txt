   COREY RIPS BUT WE CANT LOOT
   The Outskirts of Newport
   The Old Road is intersected here by the cobblestone road leading to the
   small fishing community, Newport. Beyond Newport is a bay of the New
   Sea,
   its waters stretching out across the horizon. The cobblestone continues
   to
   the north, signifying the beginnings of a major trade route to the
   towns of
   Solace and Haven further to the north. The majestic forests of the
   fabled
   elven capitol of Qualinost deepen to the southwest. If you travel south
   you
   can also come upon Pax Tharkas. If you travel north, you will hit the
   River
   White Rage.

   The gates of this village are constructed of mighty vallenwoods
   imported
   from the northern forests. A pair of lanterns hang from each side and
   are
   continually maintained by the local guards for continuous light. The
   danger
   of attack from the dragon armies is always a threat in these parts. A

   invite you in.

   Western Gates of Newport
   The gates of this village are constructed of mighty vallenwoods
   imported
   from the northern forests. A pair of lanterns hang from each side and
   are
   continually maintained by the local guards for continuous light. The
   danger
   of attack from the dragon armies is always a threat in these parts. A
   sea
   breeze blows softly from the east and the smells and sounds of Newport
   invite you in.
   Nigora, Caretaker of the Sigil is standing here. (flying)

   Rapid's Drive at Bubbling Brook
   The street curves out to align itself north-south here. The gates to
   your west are constructed of mighty vallenwoods imported from the
   northern
   forests. A pair of small lookouts have been contructed on each side of
   the
   gate to provide an early warning to any attack that may arise. The road
   curves off to the northeast and southwest of here.

   Bubbling Brook Street
   The cobbled Bubbling Brook extends east and west here. To the west, the
   western gates made of vallenwood can be clearly seen. There are sounds
   of
   horses neighing coming from the north, while the sounds of swordplay
   emanate
   from the south. To the east is the town square.
