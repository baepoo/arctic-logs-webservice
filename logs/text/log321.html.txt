   Northern Avenue
   You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
   through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to
   form
   a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and
   hear
   Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
   east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
   strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at
   the
   edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

   Solace Square
   Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
   huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
   their
   limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
   clearing
   here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
   spot
   in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
   north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
   huge
   vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some
   sorts.
   A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
   the
   thick limbs which house the guild hall.
   a steaming slice of pizza is lying here. [25]
