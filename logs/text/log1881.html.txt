   A Warrior's Hut
   Strongly resembling the dwellings inhabited by the villagers of the
   tribe, this hut belongs to a warrior of the Que-Kiri. A woven throw rug
   covers the dirt ground, and several padded stools and thick bedrolls
   have
   been scattered about the area. The identifying factor is the wooden
   rack in
   one corner of the room, filled with weapons and armor. An entryway
   leads
   out of the hut to the east.
   The corpse of a fierce savage is lying here.
   Exuding heat, a salamander slithers around here.

   Road Through the Village
   Winding its way through the village of the Que-Kiri tribe, this path is
   the main road of the settlement. Packed dirt of a light brown hue forms
   the
   road, which is lined by the simple straw dwellings of the tribals. A
   few
   villagers walk about the area completing their chores, but there is
   little
   traffic aside from that. The road continues to the north and south, and
   entryways lead into huts to the east and west.

   You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
   up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the
   clouds

   decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the
   tree.
   The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue
   to
   the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching
   the
   ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the
   stairway.

   Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking

   The Temple of Solace
   An elaborate temple has been built among the limbs of the vallenwood.
   Tall wooden pillars support the ceiling overhead. Rows of long wooden
   benches face the east, where you spy a large altar. A small aisle runs
   between the benches and forward towards the altar. You notice a small
   doorway in the south wall which appears to lead into a small room. An
   overall feeling of peace and of tranquility seems to permeate the
   entire
   temple. A small spiral stairway leads down out of the temple and into
   Solace.
   A Solace peacekeeper is here making his rounds.

   The Altar Room
   You stand before a huge altar. Behind the altar, stands a great statue
   of the god Paladine. He stands there with arms outstretched to welcome
   all
   citizens of Solace into his temple and sanctuary. The altar itself is
   covered with all sorts of rare and beautiful flowers. You feel very
   small
   and insignificant before a figure of such power and grace. But you also
   feel safe and protected. An aisle leads west through the rows of seats.
   You
   also see a doorway to the south.
