   The Entrance to the Halls of Ravenous Adventurers of New Krynn
   Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
   sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The
   flames
   are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
   possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall
   seems
   well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets
   mar
   the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
   regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
   last forever.
