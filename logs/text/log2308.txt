   Solace Square
   Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
   huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
   their
   limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
   clearing
   here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
   spot
   in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
   north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
   huge
   vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some
   sorts.
   A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
   the
   thick limbs which house the guild hall.

   The Solace Adventurer's Guild
   The guild is full of adventurers of all types, who are trying to hone
   and perfect their skills. The walls are covered with racks of weapons
   and
   armour that are used in the training. Huge book cases also fill the
   room,
   containing numerous spell books and scrolls. There are even chests and
   doors that seem to be made specifically for practice by thieves and
   their
   lockpicks. One master of all skills oversees all the training and
   progression here. A small stairway leads down out of the tree and to
   the
   ground below. A hall leads north. The Hall of Justice is to the south.
