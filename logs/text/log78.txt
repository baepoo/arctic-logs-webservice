Solace Square
Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
huge
vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some
sorts.
A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
the
thick limbs which house the guild hall.
