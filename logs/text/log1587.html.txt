   Kendrick RIP

   POV: Scelesta

   Log Rating: -2.0000

   kendrick is zexx, die

   Passing Between the Khalkists
   The mountains loom all around, trying to swallow the weary traveler in
   their barren vastness. The occasional wind from the north brings the
   smell
   of smoke, hinting that there may be a town just past a barely visible
   pass.
   To the east the rocky slopes swallow the road whole, spitting it out
   every
   now and then as it passes over rocky outcroppings.
   A guard of the underground waits in the shadows, ready to ambush.

   here. (flying)

   Near a Crumbling City
   The dreary city of Jelek rises before you to the north, past a small
   path that leads to the southern gates of the city. The road itself
   winds
   off into the mountains to the east, disappearing among the rocky barren
   slopes. The Khalkists loom all around, falling away only to the west.
   The corpse of a sneaky thief is lying here.

   Skirting the Walls of Jelek
   The mercantile town of Jelek sprawls out to the northeast, various
   stone buildings and slaver tents rise above the low protective wall
   that
   circles the city. The road widens to the east and west, while winding
   next
   to the crumbling walls to the north. East, the road leads through a
   pass in
   the Khalkists towards Neraka. West, the way looks less traveled,
   leading
   off through the badlands to the lands of Throt beyond.
