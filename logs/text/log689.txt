   Oedipus rip again

   POV: Scelesta

   Log Rating: -1.6250

   I take a stroll through the flying city only to find Oedipus.

   sca
   Looking north:
   A small dirt path leads toward the citadel.
   Oedipus, Mythical Mother Lover is standing here.
   . . . has a metallic luster.
   Looking east:
   You see nothing special.
   Looking south:
   You see nothing special.
   Looking west:
   You see nothing special.
   Looking up:
   You see nothing special.
   Looking down:
   A wooden ramp leads from the castle to the solid ground below.

   Before an Iron Portcullis
   A gentle light shines upon the entrance to a dark citadel, illuminating
   the structural cracks the lifting process caused to this once land
   based
   castle. A large iron portcullis blocks the way north into the main
   courtyard. In the corner, a small iron box would be unnoticable except
   for
   a glimmer from its pristine silver keyhole. The portcullis is a fine
   deterrent for land based attacks, but now apparently serves more as a
   checkpoint. Just to the south the land gives way to air as the
   citadel's
   base ends.
   A silver whistle case glitters upon the ground.
   A small key made of silver sits here.
   Oedipus, Mythical Mother Lover is standing here.
   . . . has a metallic luster.
   312H 64V 21516536X 883C Exits:NS> You utter the words, 'hold person'
   Oedipus freezes in place.

   say bitch
   You see nothing special about him.
   Oedipus the adult male high elf is in an excellent condition.
   Oedipus is using:
   <worn around neck> a holy insignia of Paladine..it glows dimly
   <worn around neck> a ruby and diamond necklace
   <worn on body> a shining mithril breastplate..it glows dimly
   <worn on legs> some dark steel leg braces
   <worn on arms> some dark steel arm braces
   <worn as shield> a fire-blasted shield..it glows dimly
   <worn about body> a thin, light green robe..it glows dimly
   <worn about waist> a gazelle skin pouch
   <worn around right wrist> a deep black wrist guard
   <used in primary hand> a dwarven smasher
   <held in secondary hand> a glowing scroll of recall..it glows dimly
