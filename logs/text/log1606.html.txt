   In the Ruins of an Old Temple
   You stand in the ruins of what was once a very tall building. Against
   the far west wall, you can see the ruins of what was once an altar to
   some
   god you cannot determine. The stained windows that once stood tall and
   shown with bright colors and light now lie in many pieces across the
   floor
   of this abandoned temple. The door to the east opens out into the ruins
   of
   the rest of this sad place.
   A delicious loaf of bread rests upon the ground. [8]
   A small pouch has been discarded here.
   A small stone with swirls of browns and blacks glistens in the light.
   A polished granite ball is here, with a leather necklace attached to
   it...it glows red and blue
   A torch burns weakly with a green flame here...it glows dimly
   Kang Kong, Bloodless Insomniac is RESTING here. (flying) (invisible)
