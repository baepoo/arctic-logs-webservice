   The road continues, now heading to the south. The general terrain seems
   to be getting drier and dustier, and there are fewer trees. In
   addition,
   the air seems to be getting somewhat colder. From a nearby hill, a deer
   notices you, and bolts into the woods. From here, the road continues to
   the

   To the north the plains turn into forested lands. Northwest of here is
   the Darkenwood forest and the village of Gateway. Travelling south will
   take
   you through the plains of Abanasinia and further on to the port town of

   Around you are the plains of Abanasinia. The land is very flat and you
   can see for miles and miles around. A few trees are growing here and
   there,
   along with other kinds of short vegetation bushes, brush and other
   assorted
   plants. In the distant west you can see a mountain range and a cool
   breeze
   is blowing in from the east. Looking to the east you can see the lands
   of
   the Que-teh tribe, their cooking fires trailing smoke up into the sky.
