   Southern Avenue
   Southern avenue is much smaller than the other three streets going
   through the park. Few people wander southern avenue, and the street
   itself
   is in bad shape. Potholes mark the surface, and the paving in places is
   completely gone. A few benches, old and splintering, line the street,
   occupied only by emptiness. The flowerbeds that once lined southern
   avenue
   now lay dry and decaying, a lack of care leaving them to the elements.
   Off
   to the side of the road, the park seems wild and untamed. Trees and
   bushes
   are entwined in a ritual dance for light, seeking to kill the other.
   Vines
   climb over everything, trying to stake their claim to the light.
   An annoying pigeon raises havoc in the park.

   of water fills the
   air, dampening your skin.
   Vingaard Park Square
   Park Square dominates the center of the park, and the entire town. A
   large fountain, constructed of solid copper, livens the square. Huge
   geysers of water are shot through the copper pipes creating a beautiful
   water display. A rainbow cascades across the square, adding color to
   the
   stunning scene. The square is crowded, day and night, with locals and
   tourists, all enjoying the scenery and splendor of the town park.
   Vendors
   have set up tents and display goods at their carts. Small children run
   about, chasing each other. The square is lively and full of energy. The
   merchants tents range in size from small to gigantic, all being very
   colorful.
   A large copper fountain dominates the center of park square.
