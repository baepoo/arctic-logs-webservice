   POV: Krovax/Chon

   supposedly ambushing whoever left solace inn.

   The Outskirts of Newport
   The Old Road is intersected here by the cobblestone road leading to the
   small fishing community, Newport. Beyond Newport is a bay of the New
   Sea,
   its waters stretching out across the horizon. The cobblestone continues
   to
   the north, signifying the beginnings of a major trade route to the
   towns of
   Solace and Haven further to the north. The majestic forests of the
   fabled
   elven capitol of Qualinost deepen to the southwest. If you travel south
   you
   can also come upon Pax Tharkas. If you travel north, you will hit the
   River
   White Rage.

   dot
   the waters of the bay, as Newport citizens toil away in their trade.
   The
   forested hills grow west of the bay, filling the view with tall oaks
   and
   maples. Far to the south, the peace of the Kharolis Mountains rise in
   majestic shadow.

   marks of a wagon in the dirt spots of the road, left by the increasing
   number of merchants travelling between Newport and the towns of Solace
   and
   Haven. Around you the landscape is dotted with trees and the area is
   hilly.
   In the air you can faintly smell salt, carried by a breeze blowing from

   trees you can see a large river known as White-Rage. You are in a small
   clearing, the clearing is not natural as you can see many tree stumps.
   You
   assume that villagers from Newport have cut them down for their fires
   and to
   create farm land. The forest is beginning to take back the land it has
   lost,
   you can see some small saplings already growing from the trunks of the
   cut
   trees.

   South Bank of the River White-Rage
   You stand at the south end of a mighty stone bridge. Below, a very
   large and swift flowing river roars down towards the New Sea. The river
   is quite dangerous and only the largest of ferries are capable of being
   able to properly navigate it. The bridge itself is wide and is one of
   the most impressive feats of dwarven craftsmanship that you have ever
   seen. You can also just make out a path that leads down to a stone dock
   from here.

   Crossing the River White-Rage
   Looking around as you cross the immense stone bridge, you gaze in
   awe at a pair of huge pillars of stone. The pillars seem to be the
   main foundation of the structure, keeping it a safe distance from the
   raging waters below. Even from here, you can hear the roar from the
   river below as it crashes into the pillars and is forced around them.
   The stone bridge stretches northward, high about the river, but the
   southern bank is still reassuringly nearby.

   Crossing the River White-Rage
   Looking around as you cross the immense stone bridge, you gaze in
   awe at a pair of huge pillars of stone. The pillars seem to be the
   main foundation of the structure, keeping it a safe distance from the
   raging waters below. Even from here, you can hear the roar from the
   river below as it crashes into the pillars and is forced around them.
   The stone bridge stretches southward, high about the river, but the
   northern bank is still reassuringly nearby.

   North Bank of the River White-Rage
   You stand at the south end of a mighty stone bridge. Below, a very
   large and swift flowing river roars down towards the New Sea. The river
   is quite dangerous and only the largest of ferries are capable of being
   able to properly navigate it. The bridge itself is wide and is one of
   the most impressive feats of dwarven craftsmanship that you have ever
   seen.

   trees you can see the mighty River White-Rage. The road leads north
   through
   the plains to the towns of Haven and Solace. The road you are

   is made of cobblestones in spots but in other spots it is just plain
   dirt.

   Solace Square
   Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
   huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
   their
   limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
   clearing
   here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
   spot
   in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
   north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
   huge
   vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some
   sorts.
   A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
   the
   thick limbs which house the guild hall.
   A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.

   You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting

   form
   a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and
   hear
   Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
   east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
   strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at

   decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the
   tree.
   The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue
   to
