   Taking out the Trash

   POV: Nero

   Log Rating: -2.8274

   In our efforts to keep Balifor Scum-free, Noble Blood Sea Sanitation
   workers humbly clear some unsightly rubbish from the Balifor Area.

   Intersection of Alan Ak-Khan
   Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are
   usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down.
   This
   crossroads is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and
   merchants
   alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits
   on
   the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
   Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no
   wonder
   that bandits frequent these roads.
   A small grove of trees thrives just off to the side of the road.
   A wooden signpost has been hammered into the ground here.
   (flying) Alexandros the Male Wild Elf is here relaxing with his head
   resting against a tree.
   Odrade the Male Gnome is here relaxing with his head resting against a
   tree.

   Manda the Female Half Elf is here relaxing with her head resting
   against a tree.
   A stallion is standing here, pawing at the ground impatiently.
