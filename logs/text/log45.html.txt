   On Runglish

   POV:

   Log Rating: 2.7419

   Bramag entices us with his scholarly knowledge of Runglish.

   Ah, the aesthetic beauty of the Runglish language, I thought you would
   never ask! The beauty of Runglish lies within its own roots. Originally
   formed from the two Latin words:
   Obscurus -a -um [covered , dark, obscure]; n. as subst., [darkness]; of
   language, [obscure, unintelligible]; of origin, etc. [unknown,
   obscure]; of character, [secret, reserved, close]. Hence adv. obscure,
   [darkly; unintelligibly; secretly]
   Breviloquens -entis [brief in speech]
   (Definitions courtesy of http://www.nd.edu/~archives/latgramm.htm)
   Combining the words we have Brevilobscurus - short unintelligible
   speech
   Obviously such a word could not be the name for such a short
   unintelligible language, and it was immediately renamed to Runglish by
   Sufocrates in 333 B.C. after reading the complete works of Bramamanicus
   (404 B.C.) Later at the Council of Tort in 406 B.C. Yairistotle called
   the language an absurd attempt at communication, but if letting the
   savages have a language would help quiet down the raging mobs he agreed
   to recognize it. The true origin of the language itself is kept very
   discreet by those that speak it fluently, but historians have agreed
   upon using the written works as a basis of pinpointing a time.
   Bramamanicus is believed to be the first to pen anything in the
   language, although some works of Climbertotle have been destroyed in
   what has turned into one of the biggest controversies in the history of
   languages. Climbertotle's Laws of Clan is believed to have been written
   approximately 367 B.C. while Bramamanicus's Ironstrong Fist is Mine was
   written 3 years later. Liberal Runglish Fascists are believed to be
   among those responsible for the fires that simultaneously appeared in
   every museum containing even the smallest piece of literature penned by
   Climbertotle. It is widely believed that descendants of Bramamanicus
   are the driving force behind the Liberal Runglish Fascists, and one in
   particular, Bramamanama. Bramamanama has been quoted by the media on
   several instances as saying, "Runglish Mine, Mine Runglish" and since
   the Historical Language & Grammar Society has recently renamed
   Bramamanicus as the true father of Runglish, he has been seen carrying
   chests and wearing diamonds. ("MY CHEST")
   Now that some of the history has been established, lets view at what
   makes Runglish one of most spoken and under appreciated languages.
   Runglish is complex only in its simplicity. In every other language,
   repeating words is frowned upon, but Runglish thrives on the repetition
   of short, simple words, and the lack of cohesion of thought through any
   phrase of words. Runglish is a "free-style" language, not having any of
   the structures, formats, or rules of its base languages, and those who
   speak it often can't even be understood by the most eloquent Runglish
   speakers. Very few outside of the descendants of the original tribes
   that the language originated from can ever grasp its complex simplicity
   enough to be able to speak it fluently enough to fit into their
   society. This has proven as a safe haven for these tribes as many spies
   have been found speaking Ebonics as opposed to Runglish. Although
   Ebonics is a viable language in its own right, and believed to have
   descended from Runglish, it has no place in the tribes that harbor the
   Wild language of Runglish.
   With continued research and study of the "brief, unintelligible"
   sayings that comprise of this mysterious language, linguists hope to be
   able to unlock the secrets and translate Runglish to English. Until
   then, the common man is confined to the appreciation of the grunt-like
   sounds and inaudible snarls that serve as a language for many.
   Appreciation for the beauty of Runglish is growing, as the language is
   making its first big break out in the United States. There are several
   reports of kindergarden children using words in such random order and
   repetition that it is believed with continued training they could grow
   into translators. Problems stem from uneducated teachers who are unable
   to recognize this seemingly hereditary language, and they immediately
   lead these poor souls to the confines of a proper English speaking
   life. Support for Runglish is growing and growing, and it has even been
   seen in the online gaming industry now. The ability to communicate is
   our most valuble commodity, and the more we can learn and understand,
   and perhaps one day, even speak this language, the more simple we will
   have become. Complex simplicity in its most pure form is the spoken art
   of Runglish. English words alone cannot describe its beauty. So to
   quote the bald and barbaric Bramamanicus,
   "Mines words are mine and mines too. I am one or only one of one and am
   first. All enemys trash is trash. Diamonds are shines and makes powers
   in me. Give mes diamond. Give mes diamond. Give mes diamond. MINE.
   Gives me chest or gives me deaths. I am crush of all enemy, and crush
   trash. You got what deserve making ironfist crush you. I am not suck, I
   am crushor."
