More fun times...

In the Hall
This is the western side of the residential hallway. Two wooden doors,
to
your north and south, appear to be the entrance to the priests'
quarters. The
door to the north is of particular interest. It is larger and more
sturdy
looking than the other. It is also marked with a strange, archaic
symbol.
Torches are mounted next to each door, in a metal torchholder. The
blue-
carpeted hallway runs farther east to a bend in the hallway, and west
to the
temple entranceway.

Entrance Hall
A dark blue carpet runs from the doors to what appears to be the temple
itself, to the south. Through the stone archway can be seen vast rows
of pews.
To your west appears to be some sort of confessional, where the town's
sinners
come to clear their consciences. Eastwards is a long, dimly lit hall.

493H 156V 5966786X 3.71% 868C Exits:NESW> The Confessional
The dimly lit room is tight and cramped. It wasn't meant for more than
two
people - the sinner and the priest. There is a wall separating one side
of the
room from the other, with a dark screen inset so the priest cannot see
you. Or
maybe the priest is just ugly.
The corpse of Kovorka is lying here.
