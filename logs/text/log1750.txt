Going after a some enemies

POV: Draegnius

Log Rating: 0.5000

Yes, it's boring, but a kill's a kill.

You follow Prik west.
Outside the Dwarven Miner's Guild
The facade of the Dwarven Mining Guild is quite impressive. Intricately
carved statues of dwarven miners jut out of the solid rock of which the
guild is cut from. Emeralds, rubies, amethysts, and topazes are
encrusted
within the rock, dandifying the already flamboyant display. The tunnel
expands before the guild in almost a large forum. Some miners are
visiting
the variety of food stalls set up outside of the guild, taking a quick
break in their days work, while others lean against the building
chatting
over new drilling techniques. The guild stands three stories tall, as
noted
by the hollowed out rock holes, which serve as windows. To the east
lies
the entry hall of the prosperous guild, while the path to the south
takes
you away from it.
A small campfire fills the area with a warm, comfortable glow.
Prik the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here. (invisible)
Cole Safine, Diamond Jeweler is standing here. (flying)
Zig Zaggin Through the Swarm of Insects is standing here.
