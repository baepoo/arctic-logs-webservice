The Street of Kings
Large stone and wooden buildings line the main street of Lemish, the
famous Street of Kings. The street was named after the long line of
kings
that ruled the province up until the fall of the city to the highlords.
The city appears rather run-down and dirty. Where pristine paths and
parks
once stood, there is nothing but heaps of trash and decaying foliage.
The
people of the city seem depressed, almost as if they were captives of
something. It seems that the city is in anarchy. The street ends in a
cul-de-sac here. There is a sign to the south.

You follow Gudbrand south.
Entrance to the Government Building
A large and busy hall greets you as you walk in. There are people and
draconians running around, running tasks for whomever is in charge.
Most
of the people don't pay attention to you, thinking you are only
mercenaries
that have come to cast your lot with the armies of the Dark Queen. The
draconians, on the other hand, stare at you with contempt and hatred.
There are two doors leading east and west. Near the southern end of the
hall, there is a small, spiral staircase that leads up. Though this
building was once used as a city hall, it has been converted to the
headquarters of the Highlord's rear flank.
