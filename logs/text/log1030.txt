An Abandoned Tunnel
With every step you take through these abandoned tunnels, the bottoms
of your leg become thoroughly soaked, as your footsteps kick up the
foul
pools of water underfoot. The tunnels are large enough for a trio of
ogres
to walk upright, shoulder to shoulder, and the ceiling above you is
shrouded by darkness. The poignant stench of mildew emanates from the
wet
dungeon walls, and you find yourself wishing to be out of this maze of
darkness.
Sancho Lopez, God of Questors & Gladiators is standing here.
Uther Assante is standing here. (flying)
