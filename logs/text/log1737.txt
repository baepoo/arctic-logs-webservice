The Eastern Road
A small, rugged road cuts through the forest here. A small town lies to
the west, while the forest thickens to the east. There is a small,
crude
sign posted here.

The East Gate
A large wooden gate blocks the road here. This gate protects the town
of Solace from invaders who would invade and plunder the peaceful town.
This gate and guard post seems to be an effort to prevent this
occurrence.
Those leaving Solace venture east through the gate and into the wild
forest
beyond. Eastern Avenue also leads west, into Solace, from here.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here.
A Solace peacekeeper stands here, vigilantly guarding the town gates.

Near the Shore of Newsea
Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty
water into the air. Strong gusts from the north whip at your clothes
and
kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon
to
the western horizon, all that can be seen are the waters of the Newsea.
Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land
mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes
more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.
A large ferry braves rough waters of the Newsea.
A large wooden sign has been hammered into the ground here.

You are on the rough waters of Newsea. The weather is harsh and the
sky is gloomy. It is very tough to navigate through the turbulent
waters,
large waves and strong winds seem to cover much of this sea. The waters
here seems unnaturally dark, and you see few signs of sea life.

West End of Bridge
Groaning loudly, the wood of the bridge slightly gives way as you step
on it. In the distance, across the waters of silver, buried beneath a
shroud of white, the thin wailing reverberates through the air. Ghostly
shapes, high above, flit about in the maze of fog, like the noble
steeds of
a chariot they pull the wailing of the banshee across the lands. Over
the
bridge, both southward and northward, the river boils violently,
bubbles
burst spraying scalding water across the surface of the bridge.

Suspended over the water, the bridge sways slightly as the steam pushes
its underside. To the east, as a great wave of mist separates, the
plains
of Daltigoth can be seen stretching far across the lands, and hurridly
meeting the base of the mountain range. Westward, the Dragon Monument
stands proudly on the northern side of the River of The Dead.

The small street leads in a north-south direction. The smell of

in a

death. No wonder the tall houses seem to be empty and devoid of

The street ends in a rough-shod barricade. For some unknown reason, the
peasants that once lived here seem to have left and tried to stop
outsiders
from entering this area. Several burnt torches have been stuck into the
walls, finding niches and holes in the crude furniture that has been
used
in a futile effort. It seems that had the barricade not been there, you
could probably have found a way to get back to the main square from
here. A
tall, deserted house lies to the west, its door has been forced open
and
there is a faint smell of ashes and old smoke. A symbol of death
appears to
have been carved into the wood surround with a knife.
***Ran back. Ardrathin makes his dt save, Nique isn't as lucky.

beam
of golden wire that falls just on the other side of the river. Looking

wet
air as if held aloft by something, or someone.
