You have entered the King of Sorinthalas's room. Present are many
silken fineries and artistic works, sent to the king for his approval.
Also
present are many baskets of food and sweets. From what you are able to
deduce, the king is either widowed or the children are inherited, as
there
are no female belongings in the room. Laid out on the bed are many
silken
robes and clothes. The bed itself is in fine shape, with bedposts and
head
rest made of carved oak. The only exit lies to the west.
The corpse of Scelesta is lying here.
A stout elven guard stands here, protecting the King.

The elven king paces around, pondering some unknown problem.
