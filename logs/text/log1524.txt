A Twisting Hallway
Twisting on it's way through the ground floor of this building, the
hallway runs south to a stairway and east where it curves around the
corner
of a mess hall. Two stone archways lead openly to the north and west,
into
the soldiers' barracks. A chilling breeze runs through the hallway,
sweeping across the building through open windows.

The Ground Floor
Fresh air wafts in through an open window south, set within a stone
wall. Leading back down to the basement floor is a flight of stairs,
and to
the north the hall continues on to a broad intersection. The east and
west
walls hold a leaking wax candle each, keeping this area lit throughout
the
night though they do little to heat the cold stone walls.
