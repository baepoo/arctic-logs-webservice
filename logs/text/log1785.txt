POV: Marial

Log Rating: 3.1600

Miss flies south.
You follow Miss south.
Melina flies in from the north.
Dralan flies in from the north.
Into Thin Air
<BSP> Dralan the Mighty is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
. . . is enveloped in flames.
Miss Melina, Princess of Pain is standing here. (flying)
. . . has a tough exterior.
<BSP> Miss Miss, U'Luze is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
. . . has a tough exterior.
377H 115V 11959319X 163C Exits:ND>
Melina tells your group 'feeble?'
377H 115V 11959319X 163C Exits:ND>
Miss waves happily.
377H 115V 11959319X 163C Exits:ND>
Dralan flaps his arms frantically as he plummets down the cliff face.
Melina flaps her arms frantically as she plummets down the cliff face.
You frantically flap your arms in a humourous, desperate attempt to
fly.
Beside the Cliff Face
Miss Melina, Princess of Pain is standing here. (flying)
. . . has a tough exterior.
<BSP> Dralan the Mighty is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
. . . is enveloped in flames.
Miss screams 'AAAAaaaaaa...' as she whizzes down the cliff face.
377H 115V 11959319X 163C Exits:D> say watch out with dragon
You say 'watch out with dragon'
377H 115V 11959319X 163C Exits:D>
Dralan laughs heartily.
377H 115V 11959319X 163C Exits:D>
Miss reaches terminal velocity, screaming the whole way down.
You scream as your body reaches terminal velocity.
It is pitch black.
<BSP> Miss Miss, U'Luze is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
. . . has a tough exterior.
Melina screams 'AAAAaaaaaa...' as she whizzes down the cliff face.
Dralan screams 'AAAAaaaaaa...' as he whizzes down the cliff face.
377H 115V 11959319X 163C Exits:D>
Natya tells your group 'wtf?'
377H 115V 11959319X 163C Exits:D> Dralan shoots by at terminal
velocity, screaming the whole time.
Melina shoots by at terminal velocity, screaming the whole time.
You see the boulders below racing towards you at terminal velocity.
The Talus Slope
Miss Melina, Princess of Pain is lying here, dead.
. . . has a tough exterior.
You see the outline of a life form here, carrying: a ring of the
dweomer; a granite ring; a blood red cape; a fiery red armba
nd.
You hit the ground with great force and break your neck!
You're dead.
You stop following someone.
You are now the new leader of someone's group.
You sink gently to the ground.
The metallic luster of your skin fades.
