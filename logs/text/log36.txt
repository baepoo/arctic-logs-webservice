To the east stand thick wooden gates reinforced with iron bars. Large
wooden walls rise up beside either side of the gate and block your view

Kalaman. Above the gate you can see Solamnic Knights on patrol on the

fields.

Beyond the City of Kalaman
Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two
paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off
to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there
is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

fields, and toward the river.

manure. Around you grass is blown in the wind, growing thicker as it

heavily of manure. Along the eastern side of the trail a wooden fence
has
been set up to protect the fields, while to the west a thick forest,
strangely lush and thick in an area where fields are more common. The
wide

horrible

Curving Away from the Shore
The trail here heads towards the shoreline of the river, and into the
plains south of here. The river stretches out a little ways north of
you as
it makes it's way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in
with
sandy dunes. Scattered among the dunes are pieces of driftwood that
have
been washed up over the years from storms off the ocean.

banks

This vast expanse of grass and bushes surrounds the High Clerist

In front of you lies the High Clerist Tower. Placed in the winding

Knights. From a glance, the tower looks very strange indeed, it doesn't
look very much like a fortress. With portcullises on many sides, you
boggle

I received the following notice from Twinlark's manager (Lazarus):
"i'm going to take twinlark's crash today as a sign i should
visit and clean off it's fans and ducts and such, i haven't been
there in a while. i'll also install a new kernel with serial
console support. This will happen during lunch time (PST)
sometime next week..."
Please expect an interruption of the game while this maintainance is
carried out. Please do not flood us with emails begging to put the game
back during the machine's downtime, we will not get them until after
the
fact anyway. If I get anymore information, I'll be sure to pass it
along.

No new applications for immortals will be taken at this time. Also, all

I just moved about 2500 miles and my internet connect/living situation
