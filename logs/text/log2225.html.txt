   A Hidden Back Room
   The backroom of this house was obviously meant to be secret. The
   western wall has no sign of any door or windows. You do not see any
   exit or
   entrance into this room, and if the wall had not been partially
   destroyed
   you would not be in here. The lack of any windows causes this room to
   be
   eternally dark, especially in the corners. This room has fared better
   than
   the rest of the house, the walls are in good condition, the floor is
   mostly
   covered with a layer of dust. Some tables and chairs are scattered
   around
   the room, as if people once used this room as a meeting place.
