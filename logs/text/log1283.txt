   been built as a rest stop to provide a safe haven for travellers. The
   hovel
   sits off to the west of the main road here. The road itself stretches
   out
   to the north and east. The terrain to the east becomes dry and dusty,
   while you can see what appears to be a forest on the edge of the plains
   to
   the north.
   Gad, Renegade of Daltigoth is resting here. (flying) (invisible)
   back Gads. . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.
   A fellow traveller is here, weary from many days on the road.
