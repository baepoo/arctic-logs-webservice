   In Front of the Fireplace
   The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern, but here is where that
   coziness is most felt. A bright blaze burns in the huge fireplace that
   fills the wall to the south. The extra heat doesn't seem to bother the
   people gathered around the largest table in the inn. They continue
   chatting
   among themselves as the waitress delivers them a fresh bowl of spicy
   potatoes and a new round of frosty bottles.
   A red-haired young lady is wiping down a table here.
   Sahib, captain of the Solace peacekeepers patrols the area.
   You see Profion hiding in the shadows.
   An almost bald, red faced gentleman sits at the end of the table,
   talking quite loud.
   A plain yet refined looking lady is listening to the mayor's loud
   mouth.
   An elderly man keeps flicking his potatoes at the fire.
