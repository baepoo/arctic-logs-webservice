Zoning
[26]View Comments (3)

POV: Redza/Zedar

Log Rating: 1.2727

Part I: We were peacefully zoning, and I recalled to go learn at guild
and get summoned back. Aquesahm tried to hit in the wrong moment but
escaped. Part II: Ryder tries to disrupt our zoning but his plans get
twisted.

terror. The trees of Silvanesti are weeping blood. The forest extends
in
all directions.
