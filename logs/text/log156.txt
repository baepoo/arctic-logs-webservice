   Master's Office
   This is Zardonna's office and also the classroom of her small school.
   There are two rows of seats set opposite her desk. A large blackboard
   and a

   Sorcerer's Lounge

   Entrance to the School
   The building is not very large and looks quite humble. The master of

   But because of the mages' esoteric nature, people really aren't
   certain.
