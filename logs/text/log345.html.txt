   The Ebullient Elephant Inn
   This spacious tavern is full of customers. This is obviously a favorite
   hangout of many of Palanthas's middle class citizens. There is a bar
   against one wall and a staircase leading upstairs to the room clerk's
   office. The only exit is back north to Sword Street.
   Floyd, the barkeep, idly whistles a merry tune while polishing the bar.
