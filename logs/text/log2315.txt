   A Dark Deserted Alley
   The alley runs behind two buildings to the north and south. The tall
   brick walls conceal you in their deep shadows. A foul stench drifts
   from
   some trash and refuse piled up against the walls at spots. Save for the

   no
   one in the area.
   The corpse of a small horse is lying here.
   Orokusaki is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
