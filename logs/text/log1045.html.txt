   Welcome to the land of Krynn.
   The Reception
   Although this inn does not look very reputable, at least it has warm
   beds and anyhow, it is safer than sleeping in the streets of Neraka. A
   small counter stands here with a little brass bell, although you should
   not
   use it for fear that the receptionist gets angry. It looks as if she
   has
   had a hard day already.
   A large loaf of bread sits here in a small pan. [7]
   The receptionist sits here, looking very flustered.
   Standing in shadows, a draconian guard hisses occasionally.
