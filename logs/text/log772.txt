   Surrounded by Sand
   There is nothing but sand as far as the eye can see. There are no
   carrion birds in the sky nor is there any plant life. This is truly a
   place
   of death where nothing can survive. The stale and stagnant air only
   makes
   the heat more noticeable.

   A Shattered Gate
   The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
   steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
   These
   gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
   that
   it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
   before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
   enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
   rest
   on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted

   The Tarsis Wastelands
   The faint smell of decaying trash wafts in from the west on an unfelt
   breeze. Although the city has long since been abandonned and deserted,
   leaving the dump unused, the prominent smell of garbage will probably
   linger here for some time still to come.

   The Tarsis Dump
   A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
   gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
   wind is
   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
   stirs.
   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
   what
   you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.

   The Tarsis Wastelands
   The smell of filth still lingers in the air here, a remnant of the
   cities dump that rests just a short distance to the south. A short

   Before The Wastelands of Old Tarsis
   The large desert like area known as the tarsis wastelands rise before
   you to the east, once a nomans land of thieves and prostitutes, they
   now
   serve as an uninhabited boundary for the ruins of old Tarsis. A trail
   leads
   off to the north into a thick forest of ancient trees that climb high
   into
   the air. The path to the south leads into a dense swamp filled with
   thick
   vegetation and unbearable humidity.

   Before an Ancient Forest
   This small path is surrounded by trees that grow thicker to the north
   as it moves into a dark forest. The ancient trees reach high into the
   air,
   their wide trunks surrounded by healthy shrubbery. The path to the
   south
   leads toward the western gates of Old Tarsis.

   A Path in the Forest
   The path seems to lead deeper into the forest, there's a stillness in
   the air as though violence can erupt at any moment. The silence is
   pervasive yet somehow comforting. Huge trees tower over the forest
   floor.
   One can only wonder at their age but clearly they most predate the
   cataclysm. The forest is thick and very little light filters through
   the
   trees.
