   POV: Chantar

   The alley runs parallel with traders street, and is really nothing more
   than a gutter between the tall buildings of Cannery Row and High
   Street.
   The narrow, unlit alley is obviously used as a shortcut between the
   two.
   You feel unusually nervous as you walk here, and small movements in the
   shadows catch your eye. As you move along, you realize that your ears
   are
   ringing because you are listening so hard.

   The Seedy Lane
   A very dark and foggy lane, the smell of evil evades the once fresh air
   around you. In the distance to the west you can see a faint glow of
   light
   and hear much cackling and laughter. The occasional sound of breaking
   wood
   echoes around the damp walls that keep the cold from the hovels in this
   part of town.
