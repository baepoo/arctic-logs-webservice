   The Tollhouse
   This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
   Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
   A
   road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
   main
   keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
   for
   those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
   table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
   wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
   coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
   Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
   Palanthas,
   north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
   A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.
   You see the outline of a life form here, carrying: the robes of
   darkness.

   Welcome to the land of Krynn.
   The Halls of Vague Ambition
   You are overwhelmed with awe as you enter the Hall of Forgotten Heroes.
   Before you stands a double row of statues, each one a monument and
   memory
   to the greatest members of your Clan from days gone by. At one end of
   the
   room stands a small altar, with dedications to all the Gods of Krynn,
   testament to diversity of faith of the members of your Clan. At the
   other
   end of the room is a check in desk, and stairs leading up to rooms in
   the
   stronghold. A wizened man sits patiently at the desk, waiting for Clan
   members to return for rest and recuperation, and perhaps share a tale
   of
   their latest adventure.
   A sample of a scarlet hued mineral has been mined and saved.
   A collection of small crystal spheres roll about on the ground.
   A remnant of a shattered mirror is here.
   A small stone tube is sitting here.
   A large waterskin is lying here. [5]
   The stronghold's innkeeper is standing here, giving you a suspicious
   look.
   Kadaj tells you '><'
   Kadaj tells you 'the only thing i took was your 571'
   Kadaj tells you 'the tollmaster must be paid.'
   You tell Kadaj 'lol'
