The Pig and Whistle
You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in
the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit
and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to
the
west is a meeting room.
A swirling red disc floats here.

The Tavern Square
Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A
dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street
and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp
on
the tavern wall.
