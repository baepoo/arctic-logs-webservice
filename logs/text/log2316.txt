   Killed off a Mael thief

   POV: Ajik

   Log Rating: 3.0000

   A few somewhat shinies...

   e
   The Edge of the Training Grounds
   Uninviting air sweeps through the makeshift medical barrack to your
   west, carrying with it the tangy odor of fresh blood. Two green doors,
   with
   a sign on them, set in the dark brown walls lead into another section
   of
   the grounds to your east. To the south, the room opens up widely into a
   field within the building. Various weapons sit shattered and useless
   throughout the grounds, some stained with dark streaks of blood and all
   around the floor and walls have been chipped by heavy blows.
   The corpse of a dragonarmy trainee is lying here. [2]
   A demon is here, phasing in and out of reality at random points in

   The Halls of Maelstrom
   Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
   sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The
   flames
   are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
   possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall
   seems
   well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets
   mar
   the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
   regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
   last forever.

   The Entrance to the Halls of Maelstrom
   The stench of sweat and grime hits you like a charging remorhaz as
   you enter the room. Not surprising, given how active your clan has been
   lately. It seems like they have single handedly rid Krynn of the last
   of
   the dragons and pulled down all the strongholds of the greatest lords
   and
   leaders. Yet somehow more pop up each day and your Clan fights on to
   bring order and domination to the world. The bright fireplace warms the
   room and provides the light for you to see your way to the bar and
   check
   in desk. Several waiters and waitresses bustle too and fro, bringing
   the
   much needed ale and sustenance to the worn out heroes. A bell hop
   stands
   by the check in desk, ready to stow your gear. The concierge stands by,
   ready to collect your Clan contribution before you head upstairs to
   your
   room and rest.
   A very dark colored robe has been thrown in a pile...it glows blue
   Someone has left their plate mail lying here in a heap.
   The stronghold's innkeeper is standing here, giving you a suspicious

   The Halls of Maelstrom
   Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
   furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be
   toward
   the making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and
   armor,
   the master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to
   time.
   Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released
   from
   the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.
