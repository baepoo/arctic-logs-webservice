Solace Square
Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
huge
vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some
sorts.
A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into

Southern Avenue
Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern
has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. You also notice a
small
stairway which spirals down around the trunk of the vallenwood. The
avenue
also leads north and south into other parts of Solace.

to
provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the
sun,

vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you
notice a
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway
spirals
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the
temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west
