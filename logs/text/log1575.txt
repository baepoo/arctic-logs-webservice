   Southern City Gates
   You are inside the southern city gates. The gates are made of thick
   wood, reinforced with iron bars, and are very tough to break. The
   gateway
   is arched, and above you you can see steel bars that can slide down in
   case
   of siege or attack.
   A woman with a bag of groceries is making her way home.
   A cityguard of Kalaman looks about for signs of trouble.

   Intersection of Vingaard Avenue and Wall Road
   You are at the intersection of Vingaard Avenue and Wall Road. Vingaard
   Avenue runs north-south through Kalaman, while Wall Road runs along the
   inside of the city wall. To the north, you see the busy market square
   of
   Kalaman, while the city gates to the south will lead you out of the
   city
   and onto the open plains.

   Outside the Southern Gates of Palanthas
   You are outside the city gates of Palanthas. There really isn't much of
   a city wall for Palanthas. The citizens of Palanthas don't think a city
   wall is very becoming of their beautiful city, they would rather show
   case
   their pride and risk their safety. Therefore the city gates are always
   open.

   You utter the words, 'force bolt'
   Your force bolt shatters Jenie's skull into lifeless goo.
   Jenie is dead! R.I.P.

   The death cry of Jenie echoes from somewhere nearby...
   You stop following Jenie.
   Jenie starts following you.
   You are now the new leader of Jenie's group.
   Jenie stops following you.
