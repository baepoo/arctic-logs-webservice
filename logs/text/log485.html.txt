   The Intersection
   You are at a huge intersection in the forest. Southern Avenue meets
   with Park Road and Forest Lane here. There is a small opening in the
   trees
   above that allows a view of the sky above. A small breeze blows through
   here and you inhale deeply. Southern Avenue leads north and south from
   the
   intersection, while Forest Lane leads off west and Park Road exits to
   the
   east.
   Taikoubou the Male Human is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
   . . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.
   A citizen of Solace moves quickly about.
