Harvesting in Que Kiri

The interior of this straw hut is similar to most of the others in the
village, but it is also considerably larger and more luxurious. A large
wooden rack filled with weapons and armor sits in one corner of the
room.
The dirt floor is covered by a thick carpet of soft animal fur, and
several
stools and thick bedrolls lie upon it. The main road of the village
lies
through the entryway to the north.
The corpse of the Que-Kiri warleader is lying here.

A large scimitar with a curved metal blade lies here.
