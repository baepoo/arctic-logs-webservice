   Wild bites the dust. Luckily he was afk, because I screwed up order of
   how mages do things.

   A Gambling Den
   A small gambling room for the rogues. There is smoke all over the
   room. Several unfriendly people are sitting at a round table staring at
   you. You had heard noises here before but it became silent the minute
   you
   walked in. The walls of this room are covered with brown drapes, and
   you
   notice a hidden doorway to the north.
   The corpse of a gambler is lying here. [2]
   A devious looking man is here gambling with other scoundrels.
