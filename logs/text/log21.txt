Drunk Hele tries to solo Aspre

POV:

Log Rating: 3.4706

Poor Hele was soporifically drunk and tried to kill Aspre all by his
lonesome.

677H 144V 11207086X 4608C Exits:N> l mound
Before you rises a vile-smelling mound of garbage. It is about the size
of a
small shack with all sorts of sharp and nasty bits of garbage poking
out of it.
Somewhat uncomfortably you notice that this mound is moving under its
own
volition. Looking closer at the beast, you are aghast to see little
bits
of some unidentiable cadaver rise to the surface of the trash as it
moves
steadily towards you.
A shambling mound is in an excellent condition.

677H 144V 11207086X 4608C Exits:N> The Mercenary Outpost
You stumble into a small alcove in the cavern. The walls are smooth but
stained black with blood. A small firepit and a crude cot are the only
things you can discern in the pale light. You see a list on the wall
and
realize that this is not just any mercenary camp, but the home of the
most
feared mercenary in all of Krynn. You beat a hasty retreat, hoping not
to
wake Aspre Tohz.
A very large mound of vile smelling trash appears to be moving towards
you.
