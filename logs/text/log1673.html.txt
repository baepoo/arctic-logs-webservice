   POV: Matisyahu

   There is no justifaction for this kill beyond my greed for blood, the
   equipment was a bonus. I represent the moral decay of society. Rurh
   sucks at life.

   The Knights' High Road
   You travel along a very long road, extending as far as you can see
   through the seemingly endless Solamnic Plain. The road is wide and
   obviously heavily used, though some tracks seem a bit old. The
   occasional
   bird flies high overhead, quietly cruising around searching for prey. A
   light breeze blows, carrying the sweet smell of the plains with it. The
   road extends east-southeast to Vingaard, and west-northwest toward
   Palanthas.
   Shena the Female Minotaur is standing here, fighting a Knight of the
   Sword.

   East Bank of the Vingaard
   A highway runs through the Solamnic Plain, alongside the Vingaard
   River as it makes its way northward. The road is rutted and looks to
   have
   been heavily traveled, though a few weeds seem to be popping up. Large
   expanses of gently waving grasses stretch eastward to the horizon. The
   air
   is fresh and clean, the sound of the running waters in the background.
