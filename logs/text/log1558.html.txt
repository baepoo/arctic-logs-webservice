   Ronsy vs. Sigil

   POV: Rede

   Log Rating: 1.1876

   Unwilling to deal with the anguish of not being Sigil, Ronsy heads over
   to kill the first one he sees with help from Sheriffs Artie and Rede.
   Edited from the log are about 10 or 20 of Ronsy's deaths and a lot of
   useless trashtalk.

   Ronsy flies in from the east.

   The Tollhouse
   This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
   Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
   A
   road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
   main
   keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
   for
   those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
   table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
   wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
   coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
   Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
   Palanthas,
   north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
   A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.

   The Temple of Kalaman
   The inside of the temple is nothing less than magnificent. The
   integrity and craftsmanship of the temple is one of the finest you have
   seen. The walls and columns are made of smooth white marble, giving the
   place a clean and pure feel. As you look around, you see the altar just
   to
   the north, and there is also a small reading room to the west.
   The corpse of Ekhson is lying here.
   A cityguard of Kalaman looks about for signs of trouble.
