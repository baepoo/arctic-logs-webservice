Deep Mine Main Way
Near the ceiling of the tunnel, bright torches are mounted to light the
area. The central passage of the tunnel is ridden with tread marks for
mining carts, which pass by: sometimes relaxedly and sometimes with
reckless abandon. Many dwarves of the village walk on the sides of the
tunnel. From the west interesting smells of smithing and other
manufactured
goods waft into the room. To the east and south the Main Way continues.
A heavy mining cart is being pushed along by a young dwarven miner.

Deep Mine Main Way
Dancing orange flames from torches mounted near the ceiling, brightly
color this tunnel far below the earth. Being the principle tunnel of
the
village, its width and height can easily clear the consciousness of
thousands of tons of rock above. Deep treads in the ground indicate the
path of mining carts, which lie only in the center of the tunnel. The
sides
seem to have been given to regular villagers. Miners walk in groups,
while
a little lass with short whiskers can be seen carrying home some
groceries.
Dwarven children, who have not yet begun education in any of the
principle
areas of the town, play in the large tunnel, dodging through the mining
carts. The path south leads to a junction in the Main Way, while to the
north the Main Way continues.

Junction Four
The Main Way branches in two directions at the Junction. To the west a
smaller tunnel, too tight for mine carts to pass through, meanders
through
the mountain, while to the south and north the Main Way continues
steadily.
Orange-flamed torches hinged against the western wall light the
junction
and its complimentary sign. The sign consists simply of a large four. A
loud explosion is heard a good way off to the west.
A heavy mining cart rolls along the cart tracks.

Deep Mine Main Way
Bright torches, mounted near the ceiling, light the regularly used
tunnel. Huge tread marks have permanently set themselves in the ground,
indicative of the heavy mine carts regularly traveling through the
underground village. Avoiding the path of the mine carts, villagers
stick
to the side of the tunnels. There is plenty of room for everyone in the
region as the tunnel maintains its steady width of at least six
minotaurs
and height of four. The tunnel leads to both the north and east. In
both
directions lie Junctions in the tunnel system of Deep Mine.
Some well-crafted leather vambraces rest on the floor here.

Junction Five
The main tunnel of Deep Mine reaches an intersection here. A large sign
on the northern wall labels the intersection with a large number five.
Deep
treads in the ground act as tracks for mining carts. The tracks go in
all
directions of the tunnel, however the path to the east seems slightly
more
used by mining carts. Hanging heavy lanterns, which give off a pretty
orange flame, light the intersection.

Path of the Miner's
Lit by torches clamped against the walls of the tunnel, the path here
is not quite as wide or as tall as the Deep Mine Main Way. However, the
spacing is still ample. Many mining carts wheel past, heading both
towards
and away from the great dwarven mining guild at the end of this tunnel.
Dwarven mining apprentices in their young years gather in this area,
chattering excitedly. The path leads north towards the guild and west
to
Junction Five.

Outside the Dwarven Miner's Guild
The facade of the Dwarven Mining Guild is quite impressive. Intricately
carved statues of dwarven miners jut out of the solid rock of which the
guild is cut from. Emeralds, rubies, amethysts, and topazes are
encrusted
within the rock, dandifying the already flamboyant display. The tunnel
expands before the guild in almost a large forum. Some miners are
visiting
the variety of food stalls set up outside of the guild, taking a quick
break in their days work, while others lean against the building
chatting
over new drilling techniques. The guild stands three stories tall, as
noted
by the hollowed out rock holes, which serve as windows. To the east
lies
the entry hall of the prosperous guild, while the path to the south
takes
you away from it.

Entry Hall of the Miner's Guild
The entry hall of the guild is much plainer than the gaudy exterior. In
fact from the look of it, the interior of the guild in general has the
more
traditional severity associated with a group of manual labor workers.
Propped against the northern wall is a small chair, perfect for dozing.
Tracks for mining carts lead all the way to the eastern edge of the
room,
where there is a circle, allowing the carts to turn around, once
unloading
or loading supplies and goods. A few dwarves steadily watch the
incoming
and out going carts. The exit of the guild lies directly to the west,
while
in the eastern direction the guild continues.

Ore Grade Determination Station
Heaps and heaps of rawly mined materials enter from the mining carts to
the west. Here, they are examined to see if they meet the guilds high
standard of materials for processing. Over twenty desks are set up as
examination stations. When a piece is examined properly, the examiners
seem
to pleasantly place them in miniature carts on rollers, which when
filled are
moved south into the processing halls. However, in the rare moments
when
the raw materials are not up to snuff, a snarl can be seen on the
examiners
face as he hurls it against the northern wall. A small pile of the
rubble
lies here, ready to be returned to the depths of the mountain.

Processing Hall
The processing hall is split up into three major sections: metals,
precious metals, and gems. This area must be the metals area. At the
many
processing stations dwarves labor over the extraction of mithril and
steel
alloys, as well as natural metals, namely copper and iron. Processed
metals
seem to end up against the southern wall. To the west the processing
hall
continues, while to the north lies the ore grade determination area.

Processing Hall
The precious metals region of the processing hall is loaded with veins
of gold and silver taken directly out of the mines. The processing of
the
precious metals is much more meticulously watched. Tiny hammers with
blunted heads are strewn all about. Clearly, the processors of precious
metals do not wish to damage their products at all. To the south lies
gem
processing, while to the east lies metal processing. The western wall
nests
a spectacular collection of precious metals.
