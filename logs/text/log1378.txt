An Intersection Of Tunnels
You find yourself in the middle of a large four way intersection of
very large tunnels, which you hope are abandoned. Darkness branches off
in
every direction, and you are unable to make out the tunnels end. The
poignant stench of mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls, and the
floor is covered with foul pools of brackish water. Directly above you,
is
a small ladder which reaches up towards the base of a large stone
structure.

wall, leading up towards a secret panel hidden in the ceiling above
you.
