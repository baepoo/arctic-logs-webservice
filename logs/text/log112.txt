   Magra bites the dust

   POV:

   Log Rating: 5.0000

   Smooth and sweet -- nice leading by Rei/bashing by Braiden. RGB show
   their superior skills too.

   [Another one bites the dust.]
   Rei flies down.
   You follow Manthus down.
   The Foothills of the Khalkists
   You are at the base of a sharp incline in the road. The road has
   wandered between many of the foothills where possible, but this one
   seems
   impossible to avoid due to its overwhelming size. Towards your south
   the
   road cuts closer to the mountains, or you may head up the steep incline
   in
   the foothills.
   Magra flies in from the south.

   You follow Manthus south.
   Nearing the Mountains
   You are just north of the Khalkist mountains on the road here. You can
   make out a small village nestled between the Khalkist mountains just to
   your southeast. You may travel north into the foothills of the
   Khalkists,
   or east towards the mountains.
