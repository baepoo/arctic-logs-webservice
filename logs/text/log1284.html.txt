   Traders Street
   The narrow trading street continues to the north, where it leads to the
   docks that provide the town with its revenue. The cry of seabirds is
   carried on the sea breeze. The occasional flash of white in the sky
   confirms the presence of gulls. To the west lies Guild Road, where
   adventurers of many guilds can find training in their arts.
   Gad, Renegade of Daltigoth is standing here. (flying) (invisible)

   Traders Square
   This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
   banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from
   wooden
   stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
   sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going
   distort
   your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead
   away
   from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
   cobbled square.

   An Intersection
   Heavy traffic flows in all directions through this intersection. Early
   in the morning, fishermen are heading out to pursue the day's catch in
   the
