A Large Hallway
The large hallway you find yourself in connects all the cells together.
Security is extremely tight around here, with lots of tough-looking
guards
patrolling the area. The hallway is well-lit; many torches line the
walls
to illuminate the area. Large cobblestones beneath your feet make up
the
floor, though you can see that the cell floors are made of tiles
instead.
One can continue either east or north through the hallway, as well as
south
or west into small cells.

Entrance to the Tantallon Prison
This is a mid-sized room with brick walls and a cobblestone floor.
Several torches hang on the walls, illuminating the area. There is a
small
desk on one side of the room, used for signing criminals into the jail.
An
opening in the brick wall leads outside to the east, and a hallway
extends
west deeper into the prison. There is also a small holding cell to the
south, where inmates bide their time before being formally assigned a
cell.
The corpse of the prison clerk is lying here.

Kingfisher Way North
Though most of this street is rather crowded by Tantallonian standards,
the farther north you go, the more tranquil and quiet Kingfisher Way
becomes. To the east is a typical, expensive Tantallonian residential
building. However, to the west is a large brick building that you
identify
as the town jail. Kingfisher Way continues both north and south from
here,
and a small entryway leads into the jail to the west.
A gargoyle is standing here.
Delvar the Male Human is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
. . . has a metallic luster.

With an arrogant look on his face, a Tantallonian noble walks the
streets.
