   East Gate
   The eastern gate of the town is significantly weaker than the northern
   and southern gates, since for an army to attack from the east it would
   have
   to go through numerous other Solamnic held forts and outposts to get to
   it.
   But not to leave it undefended, a steel portcullis blocks the entry of
   the
   gate, and large iron gates are behind them to block missile attacks
   from
   entering the city.
