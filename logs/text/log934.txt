The roads leads east and west between the buildings and halls. To the
north is the warriors' arena, where sounds of clashing weapons can be
heard. South of you, followers of Takhisis dressed in dark metal armor
and
wielding dangerous long swords train against one another. Sparks fly

bare metal in both directions.

With the dragonarmy forces fully in occupation in Balifor, this academy

On
the walls are several large drawings of a five headed dragon and of a
very
beautiful woman.
