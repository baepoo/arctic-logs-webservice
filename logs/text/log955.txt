A Small Sleeping Quarter
This bedroom is designed to house the tax collector stationed at the
tollhouse. It is fairly small, with only the very essentials. A
featherbed
is up against the north wall, and a small table sits opposite against
the

atop
the cold gray stones. There are a few sconces for candles, but provide

dim light for the room.
