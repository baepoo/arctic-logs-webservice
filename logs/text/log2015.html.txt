   Reception
   At the top of the stairs from the inn's lobby is a small room serving
   as a room registry. Belle sits behind a pine counter, quietly reading,
   until a customer arrives. Behind her is a long rack of wooden
   cubbyholes
   and hooks holding room keys. Long halls with many closed doors stretch
   to
   either side. It's quiet and well-kept here, conducive to a good night's
   sleep.
   A ring lies here, bearing the seal of Tarsis.
   A pile of worn maps sits in the corner, free to adventurers.
   A battered old wand lies here...it glows dimly [2]
   A plate of bacon and eggs sits on the ground. [4]
   A bulletin board with the heading 'Wanted' has been posted on the far
   wall.
   <BSP> Thanatos, Touch of Death is standing here.
   You sense that you are not alone.
   Qued Troglodyte, Scribe of Darkness is standing here. (flying)
   The fez atop this well muscled bouncer's head marks him a fierce
   adversary.
   Belle Hamson looks up from her book and beams at your approach.
