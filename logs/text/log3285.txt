   Beside the Cliff
   Traveling along the shoreline here, can be tedious but it is not
   impossible. Several rocks dot the shoreline and with care one could
   probably
   manage to jump from rock to rock. But if you don't know how to swim or
   are
   scared of the water, you might not want to risk it. The water off the
   cape
   extends to the north as far as you can see, while the shoreline extends
   to
   the east and west where it borders a high cliff. The water has eroded
   the
   cliff out here, forming a nice arch in the cliff's face.
   A mercury golem stands here, its body incessantly flowing. (flying)
