Schaeffa's Sleight of Mind
The store is very neatly organized, as the shelves are aligned in a
perfectly straight row. Schaeffa likes to keep his store neat and tidy.
Or
perhaps it is simply a very good polymorph? You may never know. The
shelves
are filled with basic spell components, while more unconventional goods
are
produced from the confines of Schaeffa's robes.
Schaeffa guides you through the many shelves of stock he has. (white
aura)
