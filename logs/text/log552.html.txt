   The death cry of Hane echoes from somewhere nearby...
   360H 120V 1X 306C Mem:8 Exits:EW> You get a large pile of coins from
   the corpse of Hane.
   There were 111 coins.
   360H 120V 1X 417C Mem:8 Exits:EW> It's a pretty ghastly sight!
   Searching through the remains, you find:

   a huge bronze two-handed sword
   a shiny black band
   a red steel bracer
   a thin golden dragonscale belt
   a backpack
   a pair of black ice arm guards
   a pair of wolf's hide gloves
   a gleaming silver pair of boots
   a pair of soft cloth pants
   a red leather facemask covered in silver runes..it glows dimly
   a skeletal breastplate
   a crimson pendant..it hums softly
   an enchanted rat bone charm..it glows dimly
   a black ice ring..it hums softly
   a glowing scroll of recall..it glows dimly
   a large first-aid kit
   a scroll of recall
   a small wooden chest
   a large wooden barrel
   a small wooden chest
