   405H 140V 2608937X 73C Exits:NESW> lTraders Square
   This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
   banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from
   wooden
   stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
   sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going
   distort
   your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead
   away
   from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
   cobbled square.
   A sextant lies here...it hums softly
   A wandering preacher stands here, trying to convert the people to his
   faith.
   A young kender stands here, looking about curiously.

   High Street
   You are on the main shopping street of Port Balifor. To the west you
   hear shouts as the shopkeepers make their living. Traders square lies
   to
   the east. From the north comes the heat of a furnace and the sound of
   clanging metal. Heavy steel shutters to the south are the main defense
   of
   the bank of Balifor.
   You sense that you are not alone.

   The Bank of Balifor
   The bank of Balifor looks fairly rundown. Not surprising, since the
   local populace doesn't earn enough money to bother putting it in banks.
   Still, the bank teller, shuttered up behind a reinforced glass window
   and
   door, looks enthusiastic enough. A small sign has been stuck to the
   desk.
   Some poor chap has left his kilt here.
   You sense that you are not alone.
