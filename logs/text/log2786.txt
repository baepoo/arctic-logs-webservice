   Duels - Weep v. Cujo
   [26]View Comments (25)

   POV: Weep

   Log Rating: 1.0000

   Weep (rank 25 Legendary Warrior), somewhat curious how a Legendary
   Warrior performs, duels Cujo (Legendary Dark Knight).

   Weep bears a special shield, stats are 27str/28dex/24con,
   NV/True_sight/Imm_disarm, wears about 4x as much +dam as Cujo, lots of
   -saves vs magic and resist magic (admittedly, -saves against Cujo's
   gaze are lacking as they are somewhat rare...)
   Cujo wears 3-4 damrolls, a few +str/+dex, decent prim and average 3d5
   offhand
