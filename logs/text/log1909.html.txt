   A Tall Archery Room
   A circular beam of light falls down through the dusty air onto the
   floor, originating from a round hole in the high ceiling. Hundreds of
   light
   metal and wood arrows protrude from bales of hay and short dummies
   against
   the southern wall. A few arrows also stick out at varying angles all
   around
   the oak ceiling. Standing here, you might as well have a target painted
   on
   you for schooling archers to practice on like the rest of the dummies.
   Rock
   walls box you in on three sides, relenting to the north where the long

   Intersection of Alan Ak-Khan
   Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are
   usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down.
   This
   crossroads is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and
   merchants
   alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits
   on
   the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
   Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no
   wonder
   that bandits frequent these roads.
   A small grove of trees thrives just off to the side of the road.
   A wooden signpost has been hammered into the ground here.
