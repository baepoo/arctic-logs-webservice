   395H 124V 1X 0C Exits:NESWUD> A Shattered Gate
   The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
   steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
   These
   gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
   that
   it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
   before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
   enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
   rest
   on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
   solid.

   A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
   gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
   wind is
   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
   stirs.
   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
   what
   you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.

   would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this

   criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands

   A Shattered Road
   The state of the road has long since fallen from its former grace. This
   once busy, bustling market road has seen few travelers in recent times.
   Skeletons of the buildings that once bordered the road are all that is
   left, save the restaurant to the east that has somehow, miraculously
   survived all this time.

   Weeds separated and broken through the stone tiles that once made up
   this road, but even those weeds have long since died away. Each
   footfall
   echoes through the shattered, skeletal remains of the buildings to the

   fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken

   shattered

   and

   little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

   The Tarsis Dump
   A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
   gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
   wind is
   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
   stirs.
   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
   what
   you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.

   An Old Gypsy Wagon
   This small wagon was once cluttered with strange artifacts and books,
   but now it is a hollow, empty shell. Large sections of the roof are
   missing, and there is a gaping hole in the northern wall. A wooden
   table
   has been fashioned in the center of the wagon, and you can imagine the
   crystal ball that once rested on top of it.

   Old Tarsis Square

   fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken
   shell

   shattered
   and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced
   others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the

   Kir arrives from the north.
   Within the Broken Temple
   This large, now-empty chamber once served as the entryway into the
   Tarsis temple. The floor, once a polished, shiny marble, is dull and
   cracked, having lost it's sheen long ago. There is a chamber to the
   north
   that served as the clerics guild, and the exit to the temple lies to
   the
   east.
   Kir is standing here. (white aura)

   A twisted look of pain appears on Paus's face as he suddenly discovers
   Tsu Wei's knife in his back.
   Twinkling lights surround Paus and he disappears.
   You feel a sharp pain, then nothing, as someone's knife enters your
   back.
   Twinkling lights surround you and cover your body entirely.
   When they disappear, you find yourself somewhere else.
   Lie still, you are dead.
   That Really did HURT!
   You wish your wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!
