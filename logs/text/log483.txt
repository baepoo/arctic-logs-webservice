BSP Cheats again

POV: Kodiak

Log Rating: 1.4706

Caught evil kage soloing in solamnic. Ripped it easily but then rather
suffer the headache of evading retribution, decided to use our cheat
powers to crash the mud

Bulette Stables
This large room appears to be where the knights keep the creatures they
use to dig out the tunnels they inhabit. A number of wooden hitching
posts
line each wall, and assorted buckets for watering the bulettes are hung
on
the walls. The walls and floor are covered with a mossy organic
substance,
as is the large wooden door to your east.
The corpse of a bulette is lying here. [2]
A troll stands here grinning broadly. (invisible)
A gargoyle is standing here. (invisible)
Kage the Male Human is standing here, fighting a squire. (flying)
. . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.
A squire is lying here, about to die.

what you are looking for.

Searching through the remains, you find:

West Tunnel
This earthen tunnel is one of the main passages through this
underground complex. You can hear a few mystic phrases coming through
the
door to your north, and a faint rustling sound to your west. The room
is
lit by a magical light spell.
An arrow pointing west floats nearby...it glows dimly
A gargoyle is standing here. (invisible)

Of course what followed was our quick forming of plan on how/where to
run hide
But thankfully our BSP cheat nature prevailed, saving us the trouble.

Xaroth flies in from the west.
Near a Crumbling City
The dreary city of Jelek rises before you to the north, past a small
path that leads to the southern gates of the city. The road itself
winds
off into the mountains to the east, disappearing among the rocky barren
slopes. The Khalkists loom all around, falling away only to the west.
297H 60V 14010723X 164C Mem:3 Exits:NEW> e
Xaroth flies in from the west.
Passing Between the Khalkists
The mountains loom all around, trying to swallow the weary traveler in
their barren vastness. The occasional wind from the north brings the
smell
of smoke, hinting that there may be a town just past a barely visible
pass.
To the east the rocky slopes swallow the road whole, spitting it out
every
now and then as it passes over rocky outcroppings.
297H 58V 14010723X 164C Mem:3 Exits:EW> e
Xaroth flies in from the west.
Base of a Narrow Climb
Here the road is widened a bit, a staging area for the merchant wagons
that have to brave the steep climb of the road as it heads up into the
mountains. To the west it travels a bit easier, picking its way along
less
steep slopes. A few broken wheels and oxen bones break up the rocky
monotony of the road, showing that not every merchant successfully made
his
way down.
