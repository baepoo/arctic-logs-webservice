   Before a Large Brook
   The dirt trail suddenly ends at the banks of a large brook that flows
   through the grassy fields around you. The pleasant sound of the brook's
   babbling floats through the air and seems to play a lovely song in your
   ears. The quiet calm of the music seems to put you in a light trance of
   happiness. As you snap back to reality though, you notice that the log
   that
   once spanned this brook has fallen into the water and does not reach
   the
   other side. You do not see another way across.
