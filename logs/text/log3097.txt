   The Hall of Mages
   You stand at one end of the great Hall of Mages, the place where the
   Conclave of Mages convene and discuss the affairs related to the world
   of
   magic. Although not usually full of people, this place houses many
   important sources of information that would be invaluable for those who
   would be concerned over the welfare of magic on Krynn. To the north and
   south you see some books placed upon pedestals for you to peruse, while
   the
   door to the west leads back to the small foretower of Wayreth. The
   center
   of the hall is a short distance to the east.

   unseen sources of light hidden along the obsidian walls of the tower. A
   powerful magic presence makes your skin crawl as you look around at the
   artifacts placed around the room. You notice a pearl white pedestal
   placed
   at this section of the hall, upon which lies an open book for you to
   read.
   Aside from that, only the exits to the east and south interest you.
   A spellbook with arcane runes has been placed on a pedestal here.
