   A Granite Structure
   Carved from the inner stones of the Khalkhist's, this granite structure
   stands tall and proud, boasting tall, bronze doors facing into the

   you
   stare into its brilliance your respect for the mighty warriors
   heightens.
   To the right of the bronze doors, a plaque made of gold shines with
   polished luster. To the west, the mounds of stones covers the dead
   warriors
   of the Que Kul tribe.

   The Tomb of King Moonshadow
   Moonshadow was the last king of the Que Kul tribe. He ruled over the
   Que Kul for 20 years before he became too old to rule. It is said that
   Moonshadow, upon losing his throne wandered to the Plains of Solamnia
   and
   died by the claws of the lions of the plains. His corpse was devoured,
   but
   his memory is kept in here, in this tomb.

   Que Kul for 20 years before he became too old to rule. It is said that
   Moonshadow, upon losing his throne wandered to the Plains of Solamnia
   and
   died by the claws of the lions of the plains. His corpse was devoured,
   but
   his memory is kept in here, in this tomb.
