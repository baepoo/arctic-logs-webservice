   Before an Old Cemetery
   To the north stands a rusty bronze gate, hanging slightly off its
   hinges. Stretching to either side of it stands an old rickety fence
   surrounding what appears to be a graveyard. To the east the trail leads
   to
   the western city gates of Kalaman, to the west it leads deeper into the
   fields, and toward the river.

   Beyond the City of Kalaman
   Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two
   paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off
   to
   the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
   fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
   grasses
   rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there
   is
   a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.
