   Edge of a Clearing
   This section of forest before the clearing is relatively easy to move
   around in, and wildlife is abundant. It is bounded to the southwest by
   the
   thick impenetrable forest and to the northeast by a large clearing
   filled
   with crude huts. The ground here is covered completely in pine needles
   and
   pine cones.
   A gargoyle is standing here.
   Arckeles the Male Minotaur is resting here.
