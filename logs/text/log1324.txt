   You see nothing special.
   Kyoto the Male Half Elf is resting here.

   Looming before you are the great adamantite gates of Storm's Keep.
   Detailing of lilies and borders of thorns accent the otherwise bland
   doors.
   Flanking the dark metal gates are high walls of blackened stone worn
   smooth
   by the constant beating of the rain. The wicked wind whips about your
   face
   wreathing about your body and chilling you to the bone. Lining the top
   of
   the wall are a couple of uninterested soldiers and a pair of stone
   guardians, shaped like dragons and carved to resemble the living. The
   overall affect is quite frightening and it puts an awkward weight upon
   your
   shoulders and quickens the already rapid beat of your heart.

   The Path of Puddles
   Harsh winds and piercing rain pummels you as you make your way along
   this path. The path itself is more like a shallow river that leads
   north,
   towards what you assume would be the keep. Through the dense fog and
   the
   constant barrage of rain blurring your vision you can see the large
   gates
   to the keep a short distance off to your north. You hasten your steps,
   hoping to get out of this storm, either by forcing your way into the
   shelter of the keep, or by letting yourself get captured.

   A Curious Landing
   A large, smooth chunk of rock juts out from the island here overlooking
   the swirling and churning ocean. The landing seems quite safe and
   appears
   to be one of the favorite unloading spots for people coming to and from
   the
   island. Through the swirling mist and pounding rain you can barely make
   out
   the faint outline of a vast and dark keep to your north. It is hard to
   get
   a good focus on the keep from this vantage due to the strange weather
   that
   seems to have gripped the isle. There seems to be a path leading north
   from
   here.
   Kyoto the Male Half Elf is standing here.
   . . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.
