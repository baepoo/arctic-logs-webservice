   You utter the words, 'relocate'
   At the Throne of the Storm Giant King
   Suspended from beams high overhead are banners displaying the coat of
   arms of the royal family, and the coats of arms of various individual
   kings. No benches are to be found here, all stand in the presence of
   the
   king. The throne itself dominates the room, raised on a dais next to
   the
   east wall, the throne is over forty feet tall, and covered in precious
   gems
   and white gold. The throne was designed so that he who sits in it is in
   a
   postion to view the entire chamber, and be able to look over even the
   highest giant.
   Lord Kelpo Vonaxle III is standing here. (flying)
   . . . has a tough exterior.
   A court sycophant stands here, trying to suck up to the aristocracy.
   Chander Obre, King of Avernus, sits on his throne.
   Quintara Obre sits next to her husband.
   Rathgar Gwidian, the Queen's Champion, stands next to Quintara.

   Kelpo oohs and ahhs, as if he is really, really impressed.
   351H 183V 1X 178C Mem:4 Exits:NSW> Your weight is suddenly too much for
   the cloud to support!
   You fall, screaming, through the cloud, watching the ground approach
   much
   too fast!
   In Mid-Air
   In mid-air between the cloud castle above and the water several hundred
   feet below, one's own mortality is suddenly very clear. Only the
   ability to
   fly could possibly keep one from crashing to the water below, in what
   would
   undoubtedly be a very painful death.
   You plummet to the ground below...
   Crystal Blue Lake
   The jagged rocks lining the west side of the lake part here leaving
   an opening into a small secluded cove. Peering through the opening you
   can see a large fire giving off the smoke you had noticed earlier. Near
   the
   fire are enormous huts. You can't make out the exact size or shape of
   them
   from this distance though. The cove opens up to the west while moving
   in any
   other direction takes you out further on the lake.
   You hit the ground with great force and break your neck!
   You're dead.
   You feel weaker.
   You feel yourself exposed.
   You feel less righteous.
   The warmth protecting your spirit fades.
   Your soul feels more unstable.
   You feel yourself exposed.
   The images around you fade out of existance.
   You feel hollow and weakened as the prayer surrounding you fades.
   The ball of light following you winks out.
   The air around you loses its solidity.
   You sense the protective magic about you fade away.
   Your detect invisibility wears off.
