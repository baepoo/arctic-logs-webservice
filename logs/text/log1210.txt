Not Recommended!
You are in a large peaceful hall, the starting arena for your team. A
sense of calm foreboding invades your soul as you prepare yourself for
what
lies ahead.
IMPORTANT: Read Post 1 For Details/Rules/Etc.

Any direction leads into the arena, pick your DOOM!

The board of tournament rules is lying here, dead...it glows blue
A magical portal shimmers with an unknown source of energy...it glows
blue..it glows dimly..it hums softly
A large stone fountain with a sign on it sits in the middle of the

An Abandoned Tunnel
With every step you take through these abandoned tunnels, the bottoms
of your leg become thoroughly soaked, as your footsteps kick up the
foul
pools of water underfoot. The tunnels are large enough for a trio of
ogres
to walk upright, shoulder to shoulder, and the ceiling above you is
shrouded by darkness. The poignant stench of mildew emanates from the
wet
dungeon walls, and you find yourself wishing to be out of this maze of
darkness.
