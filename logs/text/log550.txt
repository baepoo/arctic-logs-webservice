   Tasoth almost 1 stabs Samm!

   POV: Goka

   Log Rating: -1.0000

   Samm was highlighted as randomer... We claired and found it resting
   around... But later on it was someone we knew so we gave it back all
   its stuff...

   A Small Side Street
   This small street branches off from the Street of Kings and twists its
   way though the small town. Looking around, you notice that there are
   several large houses looming over the street. Most of them are still in
   good shape, with unchipped paint. The people here some nicer than the

   The Lemish Prison
   Rather than housing people that blatantly break what little law
   remains in the town, the jail has become the home for political and
   military prisoners of the Dragon High Lords. There seems to be two main
   cells to the jail, one east and one west. To the north, the jailer's
   office
   can be seen. The jail is rather musty and dirty, giving indication that
   people imprisoned literally rot here.
