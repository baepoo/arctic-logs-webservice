   The Confederacy Vs. The Elevator

   POV: Grauth

   Log Rating: 2.7069

   The famous disney ride teaches us here what it would be like to
   actually fall 11 stories.

   l
   The Main Lift
   This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
   at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
   exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the
   fact
   that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in
   their
   design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is
   not
   much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the
   western
   and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.
   Yamoto the Male Half Elf is sitting here. (flying)

   This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
   at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
   exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the
   fact
   that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in
   their
   design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is
   not
   much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the
   western
   and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.
