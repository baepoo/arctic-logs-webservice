   Old headstones in ragged rows run in all directions here. The grass
   below your feet has become parched with time and the curse that was
   laid
   upon the cemetery. Many trees grow around you, their branches
   intermingling
   and blocking out the sky above you. Shadows cast by the trees dance
   around
   you and you see shapes moving about out of the corner of your eye. To
   the
   north lies a concrete wall, topped by spiked iron bars.
