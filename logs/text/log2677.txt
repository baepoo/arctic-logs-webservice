The Entrance to the Halls of MYTH
Stone tiles mark this section of the stronghold as impressively sturdy.
The beautiful rhomboid geometry seen in each tile is distinctive of the
finest dwarven masonry. From years of use, each tile has taken on a
polished sheen to make any homeowner proud. The oak walls on the
hallway
are kept cleanly by a variety of custodians, and the ceiling is high
with
a classic skylight window, which at the right time of day can let in a
fair share of sun.

The Halls of MYTH
Hanging from the center of a gold crown molded ceiling is a large
chandelier burning a beautiful red flame. The flame is the result of
the
burning of sodium and some other select chemical compounds, secret to
the
pyromancers of Deep Mine. A servant seems to be dusting the ceiling and
walls on a small step stool. This job must need to be done with some
regularity, as the adventurers who frequent this stronghold track in
copious amounts of debris.

The Entrance to the Halls of MYTH
Stone tiles mark this section of the stronghold as impressively sturdy.
The beautiful rhomboid geometry seen in each tile is distinctive of the
finest dwarven masonry. From years of use, each tile has taken on a
polished sheen to make any homeowner proud. The oak walls on the
hallway
are kept cleanly by a variety of custodians, and the ceiling is high
with
a classic skylight window, which at the right time of day can let in a
fair share of sun.
