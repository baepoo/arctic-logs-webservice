   320H 128V 14238255X 0C Mem:3 Exits:NES> Northern Gate of Haven
   The northern city gates stand here, guarded by several tough looking
   men. The gates are made of steel-reinforced wooden planks, and they can
   be barred from the inside to prevent the periodic goblin raiders from
   gaining entrance into the town. Far to your south stands the central
   square of Haven, and beyond that, the large Temple of the New Gods. To
   your east and west a narrow lane runs along the outside walls of the
   city.
   <Otlw> Bumpkin the Female Human is standing here. (flying)
   An elite guard of the city stands here, watching you closely.

   Rampart Way runs along the eastern side of Haven. You can see what
   appears to be a large encampment south of here, Some of the camp is
   made up
   of large sheds while others are made from tents. In any case, the
   symbols
   of the various guilds appear in front of each individual dwelling to
   the
   south of here.
