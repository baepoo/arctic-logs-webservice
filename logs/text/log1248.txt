Ded flies north.
You follow Ded north.
Intersection of Northern Avenue and Perimeter Street
Northern Avenue intersects Perimeter Street here. The avenue leads
north and south, while Perimeter Street appears to loop to the east,
circling above the region Solace is built in. What appears to be a gate
is
to the north, while you see signs of Solace to the south.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly
Ded Moroz is standing here. (flying) (invisible) (white aura)
. . . has a tough exterior.

You follow Ded north.
The Northern Gate
This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these,
that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the
forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.
