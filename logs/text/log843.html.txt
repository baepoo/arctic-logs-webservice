   Durin RIP

   POV: Selasie

   Log Rating: 1.3478

   We got some information that Renshai was zoning in khariolis. Being
   wary of only two bashers and that rynnakm might be enlarged, we decided
   to make sure we got at least one before a ninja recall.'

   The Main Drift
   The main drift splits at this point. Small tunnels branch out to the
   north and south while the main drift leads east. The mine is very
   active
   here, no torches are provided and you can see flashes of light off in
   the
   distance as miners work the hard rock. Shouts and the sounds of iron
   hitting
   rock reverberate throughout the mine.
   An old pickaxe rests with its handle leaning against a wall here.
   A sturdy small hard hat is here, complete with dents.
   A pair of sturdy leather gloves have been left on a rock.
   You see a sturdy length of thick leather lying here.

   ceiling.

   . . . is surrounded by a shimmering light.
