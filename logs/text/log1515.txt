   POV: Grauth

   Log Rating: -1.4285

   Tried to jump 10man sigil at mom on 4, led to an accidental stunning of
   one of ours, 1 rip on both sides, our loot though.

   Inner Courtyard
   You find yourself within the ancient tower. It looks to be occupied,
   however it has seen better days. You can see a large set of stairs off
   to
   the north while the keeps walls extend off to the east and to the west.
   A pile of steel coins.
   One very large hunk of ham has been left here. [3]

   Cobbled Stairway
   You see a tall staircase which enters the higher reaches of the keep.
   You can see the galley to the east and a set of bunks to the west. To
   the
   south you can see the entryway. The wind here is very cold and biting,
   as
   if the keeps walls did nothing to stop it at all.

   have

   The Parapet
   You see the winds of the Blood Sea whip around this glass encased
   parapet. You stand upon the highest point of the tower. There is the
   smell of spell components in the air. The warmth in this room is
   obviously
   not natural in nature. You can feel yourself relax as the rooms almost
   hypnotic nature lulls you into rest.

   You find yourself in a large room. There is a series of texts upon the
   walls. You can smell spell components standing in several small jars
   around the room. In some jars you can see strange animals from long
   past
   experiments. There is a large door in the north wall which is
   surrounded by
   strange silver runes. You can see a magnificent statue standing in the
   corner of the room. There is a plaque upon the wall.

   The large blocks of granite which comprise the foundations of the

   cavern.
   Long ago this was barely underground but is now, as with the rest of
   the

   A Warm Cave
   The air is pleasantly warm here though it does smell in a large degree
   like a camp fire. There are bits of burnt wood lying around in the
   chamber
   and every now and then on the wall you can see large claw marks as if
   something tried to rend a hole through the wall.

   Red Dragon's Lair
   The walls of the chamber are pitch black as is most of the floor of
   this large underground chamber. You can see a large number of prize
   artifacts from years gone by lying upon the ground. Many of them are
   now
   worthless as they have been too deeply damaged by the years. You can
   see
   that the occupant of this room was recently here as embers still burn
   in
   two braziers near the north wall. There is a large statue of an ancient
   warrior standing in the middle of the room, a large black mace firmly
   embedded within his hands.
