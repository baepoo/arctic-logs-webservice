   warm
   and humid as you breathe it. The air is filled with the noises of
   various
   unseen animals scurrying about. Rays of sunlight shine through the
   treetops
   and light up the area amply.

   In a Dense Tropical Jungle
   You are within a dense tropical forest, filled with countless different
   species of plant life. There is also evidence of unseen animal life, in
   the
   form of the shuffling and chirping sounds that fill the humid air.
   Loose
   brown dirt covers the ground, a stark contrast to the lush greenery
   around
   you. The area is amply lit by the sunlight creeping through the
   treetops.

   In a Dense Tropical Jungle
   The foliage in this area is of considerable density, and the treetops
   above grow close together and block out much of the sky. However,
   enough
   sunlight manages to creep through to light the area amply. You can hear
   the
   sounds of animals scurrying about in their daily activities and birds
   chirping merrily as they wing from tree to tree, but you are unable to
   find
   visual proof of their presence.
