Interceptor Squad Strikes!

POV: Bezinka

Log Rating: 1.7273

Kital brought down.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.
Reception
At the top of the stairs from the inn's lobby is a small room serving
as a room registry. Belle sits behind a pine counter, quietly reading,
until a customer arrives. Behind her is a long rack of wooden
cubbyholes
and hooks holding room keys. Long halls with many closed doors stretch
to
either side. It's quiet and well-kept here, conducive to a good night's
sleep.
A tiny.acorn(alt, 1) rolls about on the ground.
A bulletin board with the heading 'Wanted' has been posted on the far
wall.
Habib the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here.

338H 127V 1X 1614C Exits:D> Habib arrives from above.
The Crossed Arms
The low ceiling holds the smoke and noise close to the floor in this
busy inn. A dozen long tables stand scattered about the room and a
narrow
stair in the back leads to the upper floor. Along the south wall, a
fieldstone hearth holds a rotating spit. Several groups of adventurers
are
clustered about the various tables, each eying the others suspiciously
and
planning their campaigns in muted tones.
Habib the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here.
A Tarsian peasant whistles happily on his way to work.
A carrion crow scavenges in the rubble, looking for food.

The Drunken Dwarf
A warm, smoky place, the Drunken Dwarf is a favorite hangout for
townies and militia alike. Heavy, utilitarian wooden tables and benches
fill most of the room. Overhead are the exposed beams of a high
ceiling.
Sawdust covers the floor to help absorb frequent beer spills. At the
back
of the room is a long bar with a menu hanging behind. To the south is a
small, closed door with a sign affixed to it.
A large bulletin board is mounted on a wall here...it glows blue

Eastern Avenue
Dwarven craftsmen took pride in the work it took to lay these paving
stones. The road is wide and smooth with barely a joint or a seam to be
seen. The street is wide enough for two wagons to pass side by side. A
friendly tavern lies to the south, and the road runs east and west.
