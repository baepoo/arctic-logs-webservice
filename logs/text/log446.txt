   Log Rating: -1.6500

   Northern City Gates
   You are inside the northern city gates. The gates are made of thick
   wood, reinforced with iron bars, and are very tough to break. The
   gateway
   is arched, and above you you can see steel bars that can slide down in
   case
   of siege or attack.

   Kalaman
   You are outside the north city gates of Kalaman. The city wall rises
   high above you. To the north is the Vingaard River, and the harbor of
   Kalaman. Everyday, ships come and leave the harbor, which is a busy
   center
   for trade and meeting exotic people.
