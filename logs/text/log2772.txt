   Wild logged 10/11 with 2 no bash, dragon orb, shadow orb and Huma. We
   had 12/13 and were looking to fight. I told our group that it would be
   "highly likely" we would lose to their group. However, Wild refused to
   fight. Unfortunately, Wild killed the MUD pharoah Mavlad - a debt that
   can only be repaid in blood.
