PEEING YOUR PANTS IS COOL!

A Dead End
The bushes are thorny and too dense for you to make your way back to
the wagon to the north. The dirt trail leads on to the east up a hill
where
a path is becoming overridden with weeds and tall grass. In all other
directions the thick underbrush of the forest is choking this neglected
path.
<MYTH> Queen Onysablet, Takhisis' Lady of Darkness is standing here.

Climbing a Hill
The trail is becoming strewn with stones and weeds. Further to the
east it winds over the summit of the hill, and a bit to the west looks
to
be a dead end overgrown in shrubs. The forest suffocates the path,
reaching
up above the hill where you spot one of the largest trees in the land;
a
huge oak whos branches span out over the surrounding forest. To your
north
and south haunting calls of animals and beasts echo through the trees,
occasionally joined by a pair of gleaming eyes that wait patiently for
somebody to take a wrong turn.
