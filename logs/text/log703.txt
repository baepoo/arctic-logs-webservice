   Fields Outside of Palanthas
   You are in the fields outside the illustrious city of Palanthas,
   the jewel of Solamnia. You have a great view of the city from here,
   Palanthas is a huge city of trade and diverse cultures. The citizens of
   Palanthas are so confident that they are in no danger of an invasion,
   they don't even have a real city wall around the city. To the citizens,
   it detracts from the beauty of the city, and a truly beautiful city it
   is.

   Your skin tightens and begins to shine like steel.
   333H 160V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:SW> At the Edge of a Light Forest
   You are in the fields outside the city of Palanthas. To the west
   you see a small light forest, at the other side of the forest lies more
   farmland no doubt. Surrounded by natural boundaries, the people here
   are isolated from the wars and despairs elsewhere in the world.
   333H 158V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NES> n
   A Quiet Trail
   The forest becomes thinner here. The quiet calm of this trail
   contrasts with the hustle and bustle of Palanthas. You can barely make
   out a settlement to the north. There is a small wooden sign attached to
   a tree.
   333H 156V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS> n
   A Beautiful View
   The trail opens up onto a fertile valley. A large barn can be seen
   to the east. Finely trimmed hedges direct your view north to a quaint
   Country home. The path to the west leads to a vast cornfield. You
   marvel at how well the whole farm is so meticulously maintained.
   You sense a life form.

   Path to the House
   This dirt path leads north to the house. It is framed on both
   sides by a dense row of dark green shrubs. The path itself is
   immaculate. They must spend a lot of time pulling weeds.
   333H 152V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS> In Front of A Pleasant House
   You find yourself directly in front of the country home. It stands
   Two stories tall and is of much better construction than most of the
   Rural houses surrounding Palanthas. The owner of this estate must have
   A substantial amount of wealth.
   333H 150V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS> n
   The Front Porch
   This small enclosure is a nice place to sit down and relax from a
   Hard day's work. A small mat covers the ground to wipe your boots on. A
   Wooden bench rests against the wall. A few flower pots containing the
   distinctive flora of this region sit on the ground.

   n
   Ok.
   333H 149V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NS> A Hallway
   You duck your head slightly to avoid the low ceiling. An
   intricately woven rug covers the bare wooden floor. There are paintings
   on either side of the hallway. The hallway leads north to the rest of
   the house, or south out the front door.

   Ok.
   333H 148V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:N(S)> The Family Room
   You are standing in a large, comfortable room. This must be where
   The family comes to relax and spend time together. Hanging from the
   apex of the arched ceiling is a cast iron chandelier. A plush, cushiony
   sofa rests against the wall. A few chairs are scattered about the room.
   A wrinkled old man is here, reminiscing about his younger days.
   An old man says 'Oh, hello there.'
   333H 147V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NES> e
   The Kitchen
   A few cabinets line the wall to the east. A huge wood fueled oven
   sits against the southern wall. A variety of cooking utensils hang from
   the ceiling. Next to the cabinets rests a small wash basin. To the
   north you see the dining room and back door.
   Lora, is standing here, cleaning the kitchen.

   your so called clan'
   333H 146V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NW> The Dining Room
   This is undoubtedly the room where the family gathers for their
   meals. An oak table hogs most of the space in this room. A small
   bookcase rests against the eastern wall.
   A pleasant servant is whistling happily as she works.

   Ok.
   333H 145V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NSW> The Back Porch
   A white lattice intertwined with some kind of vine-like plant
   climbs up the walls surrounding the porch. This small patio is probably
   used for gatherings during hot summer months. A forest to the distant
   north frames the back of the estate.
   A pleasant servant is whistling happily as she works.

   Bottom of the Staircase
   You are at the bottom of an elaborately carved staircase. From
   This vantage point you get a view of most of the lower part of the
   house. You see the expansive yet comfortable family room to the south,
   and the dining room to the east. A short hallway can be seen to the
   west. You are quite impressed at the architecture.
   333H 142V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:ESWU> A Hallway
   This short hallway seems to lead to the bedrooms. Doors line the
   Walls in every direction except the east where the staircase is. The
   bare wooden floor is finely polished and cleaned. The sweet smell of
   incense wafts in from the north.
   333H 141V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:(N)E(SW)> The door seems to be

   333H 141V 10740270X 0C Mem:4 Exits:NE(SW)> An Older Child's Bedroom
   You almost fall flat on your face as you enter this room. It is a
   complete mess. Dirty clothes and toys litter the floor. There is a
   small table with an assortment of glass tubes and bottles filled with
   multi-colored liquids. You also notice the strong scent of incense.
   Whomever inhabits this rooms must be dabbling in the magical arts.
   Morlo, a young apprentice of magic is standing here.
