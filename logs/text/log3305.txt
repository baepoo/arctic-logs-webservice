By the Gates of a Small Temple
This path seems much travelled. You see many village people enter and
leave the small temple just east of here. You feel a sense of anxiety
from
the people of this village, as though they are expecting something is

<DARK> Cyrus the Female Human is STANDING here. (aggressor) (flying)
A clay golem, Mrsmith, stands here, its hulking mass rippling.
