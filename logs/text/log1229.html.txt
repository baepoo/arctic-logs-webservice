   Aldur and Gib try to pk me, could have ignore them, but decided to

   The Avenue of the Triumvirate
   Many houses of Vingaard's middle-class families stand on the north and
   south sides of this road as it passes east-west through the
   southwestern
   section of Vingaard. Most of the houses are made of stone, and are one
   to
   two stories tall. Short stone paths lead to the wooden front doors of
   the
   houses, with a few plants along its sides. Entrance to nearly all of
   the
   houses is prevented by gates that have been locked and barred, except
   to
   the south where the gate stands open. An array of small plants grows in
   the
   garden to the south, and the house appears to belong to a herbalist.

   389H 150V 1X 12302C Exits:ESW> The Avenue of the Triumvirate
   This cobblestone road travels east-west through the southwestern
   section of Vingaard. The cobblestones are about the size of your fist,
   and
   all fit together tightly. Houses of varying shapes and sizes stand
   along
   the sides of this road, most of which are stone, but some are
   constructed
   of wood. Locked gates of wrought-iron stand before the houses,
   preventing
   entry. A light smell of burning wood can be sensed in the air, most
   likely
   from the cooking or heating fires within the houses. The Avenue of the
   Triumvirate extends a good distance east and west.

   The Avenue of the Triumvirate
   Houses constructed of wood and stone stand on the north and south sides
   of this street. All of the houses are similar in their style of design,
   but
   few look the same in their size and shape. A few of the houses have
   small
   front gardens with a few plants or a tree, and most have locked gates
   of
   wrought iron that prevent entry. A light smell of burning wood can be
   sensed in the air, most likely from the cooking or heating fires within
   the
   houses. The Avenue of the Triumvirate stretches east and to the west,
   where
   it intersects Solamnus Way.

   Solamnus Way and The Avenue of the Triumvirate
   The cobblestone roads of Solamnus and The Avenue intersect in this
   residential district of Vingaard. Moderately sized houses stand along
   the
   sides of Solamnus way as it makes it way through the town to the north
   and
   south, as well as along The Avenue of the Triumvirate. A few lampposts
   appear occasionally along the two roads, but with no definite pattern.
   The
   town walls are visible at the end of The Avenue a distance to the west,
   and
   the end of Solamnus a bit to the south.

   This road passes through a rather bland and colorless part of Vingaard.
   The houses in this area have not been kept up to the same standards as
   in
   other sections of the town. The paint on those structures constructed
   of
   wood is beginning to crack and peel, and the ones made of stone have
   been
   weathered extensively. A few of the houses might have once had a garden
   in
   front, but only spare grass and a few weeds remain. The Avenue of the
   Triumvirate heads west where it ends at the base of the town walls, and
   east through the southern section of town.

   The cobblestone roads of Western Perimeter and The Avenue of the
   Triumvirate intersect in this dreary section of Vingaard. Looking north
   and
   south along Western Perimeter, little but small, deteriorating houses
   are
   visible, all packed tightly together. Various types of trash lie next
   to
   the street, and a quick glance at the gutter shows its extensive use.
   This
   area of Vingaard appears to be relegated to only the residents of the
   lowest classes. Western Perimeter extends north and south, while The
