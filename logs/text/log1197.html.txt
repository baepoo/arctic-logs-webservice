   End of the Highway
   The Emperor's Highway ends here abruptly. It looks as if perhaps the
   road was built before the Cataclysm, and that the mountains changed
   during
   that time, wiping out the road that went through it. One can still
   travel the
   road to the west. To the east, the mountains loom.

   All around, all that can be seen is the waving heads of various
   grasses,
   except for the stone Highway, which leads east and west. The mountains
   to the east are getting quite close. A small trail takes off to the
   north.
