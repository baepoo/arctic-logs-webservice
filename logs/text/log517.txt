The Great Hall
A large hall extends to the east and north. The high vaulted ceiling
is far above, hidden in shadows. It appears that this large hall is
used both as a mess hall and as quarters for whatever lives here.
Fallen
food is scattered amoung the old reeds that cover the floor. Bones
are scattered here and here, with a few half eaten carcasses near the
center of the hall. A small door is set into the southern wall.
Nason the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here. (flying) (invisible)

Nason the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
