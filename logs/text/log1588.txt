   Fioricet RIP

   BSP death

   Entrance to the Sewers
   The abandoned sewer ways of Tarsis have long decayed and rotted away
   to practically nothing. Long ago, when the great city of Tarsis thrived
   as
   the largest sea port in Ansalon, these sewer ways carried all the waste
   of
   the city out to the sea, where it was washed away. When the cataclysm
   hit,
   there was no longer a sea to wash away the waste, so the citizens built
   a
   new aqueduct to properly dispose of waste. The old sewer ways were
   buried
   under the rubble of the buildings lost in the cataclysm. The old sewer
   ways
   were forgotten and left to rot beneath the rebuilt city. It was the
   vermin,
   and low lifes who made this once proud system their homes. You stand
   under
   an archway that leads into the sewer system. To the north you see a
   long
   slime-covered passage that leads into the main section of the sewer
   ways.
   To the south, you see a tunnel of sewage and waste, and on the east
   wall
   you can see a ladder leading up to a porthole.
   The corpse of a red thorn thief is lying here.
   A guard of the underground waits in the shadows, ready to ambush.
