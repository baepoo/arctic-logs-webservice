   Joey slain by rats

   POV: Speedy

   Log Rating: 2.3043

   Lowbie pk/rippof merchant Joey gets mauled by an army of rats.

   The Ebullient Elephant Inn
   This spacious tavern is full of customers. This is obviously a favorite
   hangout of many of Palanthas's middle class citizens. There is a bar
   against one wall and a staircase leading upstairs to the room clerk's
   office. The only exit is back north to Sword Street.

   Floyd, the barkeep, idly whistles a merry tune while polishing the bar.

   Sword Street
   This block of Sword Street is in the southwestern part of the city. A
   sign hangs in front of one of the buildings to the south. Sword Street

   The clouds block your view of Solinari.
   Lunitari is full tonight. Its red light gives the clouds an odd purple
   glow.
   You feel very powerful this night.

   A raccoon stops following you.
   You are thirsty.
