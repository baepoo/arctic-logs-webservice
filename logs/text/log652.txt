   Diogenes rip

   POV: Drin

   Log Rating: 0.6250

   Diogenes attacked us then scelesta manages to avenge diogenes somewhat.

   Murdah flies down.
   You follow Murdah down.
   Saslehoff flies in from above.
   The Tollhouse
   This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
   Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
   A
   road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
   main
   keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
   for
   those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
   table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
   wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
   coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
   Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
   Palanthas,
   north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
   A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.

   Saslehoff flies in from the east.
   The Knights' High Road
   The Knights' High Road ends here, just west of the city of Vingaard.
   The city's massive town wall surrounds the city just to the northeast,
   while perched atop a hill to the southeast is the main keep, and
   impressive
   fortification. Large swatches of fertile farmlands surround the town,
   and a
   small road leads off to the north through them. Directly to the east is
   a
   small two-story stone structure, the tollhouse, used to collect taxes
   from
   people passing through the area.

   The Knights' High Road
   You travel along a very long road, extending as far as you can see
   through the seemingly endless Solamnic Plain. The road is wide and
   obviously heavily used, though some tracks seem a bit old. The
   occasional
   bird flies high overhead, quietly cruising around searching for prey. A
   light breeze blows, carrying the sweet smell of the plains with it. The
   road extends west-northwest toward Palanthas and east-southeast to
   Vingaard, its keep perched atop a hill barely visible on the horizon.
