   You are outside the city gates of Palanthas. There really isn't much of
   a city wall for Palanthas. The citizens of Palanthas don't think a city
   wall is very becoming of their beautiful city, they would rather show
   case
   their pride and risk their safety. Therefore the city gates are always
   open.
