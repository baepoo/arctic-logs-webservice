The Kharolis Mine Office
This small shack is brightly lit. A large table occupies almost half of
the floorspace and is covered with mining maps, geological maps and
various
other papers. Small spectacular pieces of ore line the window shelves
and
boxes filled with broken tools and cloth sample bags occupy any
available
space left on the floor. A large steel vault to the west is built into
a wall
of solid rock.

The Kharolis Mine
A well worn path leads in all directions here. A large building stands
to east and two smaller buildings have been erected to the west and
south.
Dwarves hustle about in and out of the buildings and hardly notice your
presence. Several benches are set around a large firepit and judging by
the
amount of empty bottles, you suspect that this place is for social
gatherings
as well.
A small oil lamp hangs from a small post here...it glows dimly

The Officers Quarters
This small room is elaborately decorated. A small gaming table stands
in
one corner and several leather pieces of furniture sit against the
walls. A
small sign above your head tells you to remove your boots. Apparently,
the
dwarves like to keep this place clean. A small locked steel door is to
the
south and small rooms are to the north and east. The exit is to the
west.
A dwarven sentry is here, guarding the cell.

This is the bedroom of the mine manager. It is plain, yet elegant. Maps
of the mine line the walls and several boxes of loosely stacked paper
sit at
the end of the bed. The room is stuffy though, lacking windows. The
only exit
is to the south.
