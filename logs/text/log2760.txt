   Before you stands a double row of statues, each one a monument and
   memory
   to the greatest members of your Clan from days gone by. At one end of
   the
   room stands a small altar, with dedications to all the Gods of Krynn,
   testament to diversity of faith of the members of your Clan. At the
   other
   end of the room is a check in desk, and stairs leading up to rooms in
   the
   stronghold. A wizened man sits patiently at the desk, waiting for Clan
   members to return for rest and recuperation, and perhaps share a tale
   of
   their latest adventure.
