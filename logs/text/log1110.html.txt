   Traveling Through a Windy Tunnel
   Roaring winds pummel you from the east. Pressure builds against your
   chest making it hard to breathe. Dirt and dust borne along by the wind
   have
   sandpapered the walls and floor of the tunnel to nearly the texture of
   glass. A few natural fissures in the rock surface provide the only
   grip.
   While the wind seems strongly intent on blowing you back upward, you
   can
   brave it further east down the tunnel.

   The Down Slope
   The passage slopes down roughly twenty degrees shy of vertical. A
   stiff breeze whips by you from below where a low roar can be heard. It
   smells faintly like lantern oil. A steady grip is difficult here.
   Carrying
   bits of dirt and dust, the rushing air has slowly scoured the rough
   tunnel
   walls and floor. The skin on your face is proving to be much less
   resilient. The wind declines some to the west but grows even more brisk
   further down.

   Through A Descending Passage
   A passage branches off from the main cavern and slopes gently down
   into the bedrock. The rock walls are rough and covered with a layer of
   dirt. An unusually steady breeze blows in from the east and rushes past
   you. Further travel is possible north into another branch, east down
   the
   slope, or back west.

   Within a Cavernous Chamber
   The monstrous cavern expands in all directions. Long stalactites hang
   down from the heights of the ceiling like daggers. A forest of rock
   columns
   rises up to meet them. The noisy flutter of leathery wings can be heard
   echoing from above. The deep shadows cloaking the cavern's upper
   reaches
   make it impossible to tell what else lurks up there. Judging by the
   horde
   of paw prints in the dirt, the cavern sees much traffic. The tracks
   stretch
   off to the north, south, east and west into a maze of tunnels.

   The bedrock walls curve high above you, forcing you to strain your

   hollowed out by an ancient underground river, which you hope dried up
   long
   ago. The musty air smells of blood and fresh bones are strewn about the
   ground. Many of them look human... Though the river may be gone,
   something
   more foul now calls these caves home.

   Beneath a Skeletal Archway
   The tunnel ends at a gruesome archway to the north. A collection of
   animal and human bones has been arranged in odd patterns to form the
   arch.
   Some of the bones are bleached white, while rotting scraps of flesh
   still
   hang from others. Set as the capstone is a chipped human skull from
   which
   still hangs one eye. Passage is possible north through the archway or
   back
   south into the tunnel.

   A Blood Smeared Tunnel
   The air is ages old and tastes stale. It hangs in your lungs like a
   lead weight. The stench of blood and something more foul drifts through
   the
   tunnel assaulting your nose. On the walls can be seen streaks of red in
   sets of five, as if someone dipped their hands in a bucket of red paint
   and
   dragged them across the rock. What appear to be paw prints run north
   and
   west through the tunnel.

   A Crevice Between the Rock
   Barely more than a thin slit between the bedrock, even a kender would
   find it hard squeezing through this passage. Pressing your back against
   the
   opposite wall, you suck in your gut and manage to slowly wiggle
   through. A
   fine shower of dirt rains down tickling your nose.

   A Dangerously Deep Pit
   This sinkhole appears to have formed naturally, however the pit is now
   used as some sort of trap. From the numerous skeletons strewn about the
   rocky floor the trap seems to work quite well. The top of the pit lies
   roughly twenty yards above you, more than high enough for most
   creatures to
   break their legs, if not their necks in the fall. The only ways out
   appear
   to be up or through a large crack in the western wall.

   Along an Old Hunting Trail
   The trail is very haphazard here. It goes a few yards one direction,
   turns sharply, then a few more yards another way. Whoever or whatever
   created it looks to have been in a frightful panic, and most likely
   lost.
   Halfway down the trail several gouges and depressions have been made in
   the
   loose dirt, as if something fell there before taking off again. The
   gouges
   appear to have been dug by hands...human hands. From the looks of it
   that
   person wasn't the hunter.

   Along an Old Hunting Trail
   Pinecones and damp leaves lie tossed aside from something or someone
   racing headlong into the woods. The lower tree branches have been bent
   to
   make way for whatever passed through here. From the looks of it, this
   happened recently, no more than a day ago. Several distinct tracks,
   hunter
   and prey, are still visible in the dirt and snapped twigs. Tracing the
   path, the pursuit appears to have started at some ferns to the east and
   continued west, deep into the heart of the forest.

   Enshrouded Within a Dark Forest
   All traces of sky are snuffed out beneath the dark tangle of branches
   and leaves. They sway gently in the passing wind. The breeze carries
   upon
   it the heavy scent of pine. The smell is almost suffocating as it
   forces
   its way into your lungs till the bitter taste hangs in your mouth.
   Panic
   begins to set in as your eyes dart from shadow to shadow.

   A Darkening Forest
   Only thin scraps of sky dare peek through the forest canopy as you
   trek deeper into the woods. The leaf litter seems as deep as snow
   drifts in
   certain places. It scatters, revealing small crawly things lurking
   underneath. The darkness makes it hard to make out a clear passage
   between
   the trees and prickly bushes. The hoot of some owls and the low moan of
   the
   wind fills your ears.
