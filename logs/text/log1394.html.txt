   Path of the Holy
   This is a small north-south path that takes you to the Temple of
   Kalaman. The minute you walk through the city gates, you can see the

   tall
   and proud in a large city. The temple is just to the northwest, and
   Market
   Street is to the south.
   A large pigeon is here pecking at some bread crumbs.
