   Inside the Gates
   This large tunnel, just behind the keep's gates, travels through the
   thick stone walls. The ceiling above you is curved and supported by
   several
   small arches, and two great arches stand on either end of this tunnel
   where
   they lead out into openness. The road's pavement is made of smooth,
   gray
   cobblestones about the size of your fist. Torches mounted on iron
   brackets
   provide almost all of the light for the tunnel. The air seems
   relatively
   stagnant throughout the tunnel, and mixes only with the fresh outside
   air
   at the ends. The cobblestone road heads north into the town of
   Vingaard,
   and south into the surrounding lands of grain.
   A small pigmy-like creature stands here.
   Gregorious de Gregarious, Controlling Chaos Storms is standing here.
   (flying) (invisible)
   . . . has a tough exterior.

   Before the South Gates of Vingaard
   Vingaard's immense iron gates stand directly to the north, where they
   present a significant obstacle to any attacking force, but currently
   they
   have been raised high to allow passage of people and horses. High stone
   walls run east and west from here, extending quite a ways before
   turning
   beyond your vision. A road heads south where it quickly turns and heads
   west, passing the toll station as it travels through fields of grain,
   and a
   cobblestone avenue heads north through the gates.
   A small pigmy-like creature stands here.

   The Tollhouse
   This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
   Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
   A
   road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
   main
   keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
   for
   those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
   table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
   wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
   coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
   Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
   Palanthas,
   north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
   A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.
