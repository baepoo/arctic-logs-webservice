growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is
none
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the

The path continues around the backside of the mountain but the east
side of the mountain is not distinguishable from the west side of the
mountain. The upper regions of the mountain are blocked by a thick fog
which seems to hang over the peak. Fierce winds howl throughout the
mountain giving it a greater sense of foreboding. There is no life
anywhere
on the mountain just a few beaten paths that do not appear to have seen
the
lines of the living for quite some time.

growing in proximity and strength as one ascends the mountain. Life is
none
existent on the mountain, as much due to the harsh climate as the
