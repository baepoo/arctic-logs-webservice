The Inn of the Last Home
The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy place. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. This corner is darker
than
the rest of the tavern, making it a perfect place for romantics to
dine.
The darkness also adds a little intrigue to those who are sitting here
because they couldn't find an empty table elsewhere.

The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern, but here is where that
coziness is most felt. A bright blaze burns in the huge fireplace that
fills the wall to the south. The extra heat doesn't seem to bother the
people gathered around the largest table in the inn. They continue
chatting
among themselves as the waitress delivers them a fresh bowl of spicy
potatoes and a new round of frosty bottles.
