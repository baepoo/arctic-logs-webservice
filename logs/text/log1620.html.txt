   ROUND TWO
   92H 112V 7328610X 222C Exits:D> dThe Pig and Whistle
   You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
   has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
   fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in
   the
   corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit
   and
   relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to
   the
   west is a meeting room.
   The Tavern owner, William Sweetwater, offers you a drink and a pie.

   92H 111V 7328610X 222C Exits:NWU> nThe Tavern Square
   Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
   races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
   peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A
   dark
   alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
   executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street
   and
   the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp
   on
   the tavern wall.
   A small leather purse lies on the floor.
   A small hoopak has been stuck in the ground...it hums softly

   A Dark Alley
   The alley runs parallel with traders street, and is really nothing more
   than a gutter between the tall buildings of Cannery Row and High
   Street.
   The narrow, unlit alley is obviously used as a shortcut between the
   two.
   You feel unusually nervous as you walk here, and small movements in the
   shadows catch your eye. As you move along, you realize that your ears
   are
   ringing because you are listening so hard.
   ROUND THREE

   This is the entryway to the temple. It is lit dimly by a few scattered
   torches, which barely reflect off what appears to be the remains of
   several
   humans. Perhaps now is a good time to turn and head back out the Red
   Door
   south of here leading back out of this grim place. The path extends to
   the
   north, while to the east lies a plain wooden door.

   The Vestibule
   The main hall of the temple begins here near the entrance. There are
   torches that line each wall, ensuring a well-lit walkway. Faint sounds
   of
   footsteps can be heard to the east, but there is nothing there but a
   wall.
   The walls are red in tint with sigils on each side resembling the God
   of
   Greed, Hiddukel himself. The path leads north, further into the
   vestibule
   or south back to the entryway of the temple.

   of

   The corpse of a young adult warg is lying here.
   18H 93V 7328251X 197C Exits:NW> wA Dark Hallway
   Continuing down the hallway is a disturbing film of smoke that fills
   the air and doesn't seem to move. This comes as no surprise as there
   are
   both dead and living rodents block the vents. The horrible combination
   are
   enough to cause anyone to gag. The path extends east and west.
   18H 92V 7328251X 197C Exits:EW> wA Dark Hallway
   It is very apparent that this hallway is seldom traveled and even less
   frequently cleaned. The torches that once lit this passage now only
   contribute to its darkness with their smoke. There is a faint stench of
   foulness in the air that causes you to cough. The path continues to the
   east and west.
   18H 91V 7328251X 197C Exits:EW> wA Dark Hallway
   Here begins of a long dark hallway. The only lighting is the dull glow
   from a few recently burned out torches. The hallway proceeds east, and
   to
   the west lies a plain wooden door.
   A small spider skitters away at your approach.
   A large rat stares at you from the shadows.
   18H 90V 7328251X 197C Exits:EW> wEntryway of the Temple
   This is the entryway to the temple. It is lit dimly by a few scattered
   torches, which barely reflect off what appears to be the remains of
   several
   humans. Perhaps now is a good time to turn and head back out the Red
   Door
   south of here leading back out of this grim place. The path extends to
   the
   north, while to the east lies a plain wooden door.
