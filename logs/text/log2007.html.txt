   A Sloping Road
   The road leads down along the slight slope of a barren valley. To the
   east the road ascends slightly, and looking down into the valley you
   can
   see a small town. The faint smell of cooking fires hangs timidly in the
   windless air. Barren, rocky soil expands around you, void of any life
   whatsoever. Frigid, bitter air offers little comfort on this tedious
   journey. The valley floor awaits below.
