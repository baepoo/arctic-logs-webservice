Ryan shouts 'any around know cabin in sandy wastelands?'

POV: Dast

Log Rating: 1.4546

Yes, we've heard of it...

climb ladder
freeze ryan
You climb a ladder up to the roof.
The Roof of a Small Cabin
The roof of this small house is oddly flat, where most houses you've
seen arch or rise to the middle. The periphery of the roof seems to
have
standing posts, joined by a handrail. The elements have done little to
diminish the strength of the teak construction, although planks of the
roof
have been removed or broken in places. There is an old dais on the
southern
end of the roof. A ladder leads down to the ground on the northern end
of
the roof.
The corpse of a nervous brigand is lying here.
<BSP> Ryan Pipes, Crusader in the Blood Sea is standing here. (flying)
