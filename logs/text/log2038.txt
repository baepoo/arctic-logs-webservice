   Vingaard Avenue South
   This is Vingaard Avenue, a well traveled street that runs north-south
   through Kalaman. Just to the north, you see the busy city square and
   Kalaman's own open air bazaar is to the east and west. Looking
   southward,
   you see the Traveler's Lodge, where most visitors to Kalaman stay.
   <PZC> Sir Staby McStahb, Goblin From The Abyss is standing here.

   Outside the Northern City Gates of Kalaman
   You are outside the north city gates of Kalaman. The city wall rises
   high above you. To the north is the Vingaard River, and the harbor of
   Kalaman. Everyday, ships come and leave the harbor, which is a busy
   center
   for trade and meeting exotic people.
