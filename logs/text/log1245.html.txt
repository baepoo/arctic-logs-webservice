   514H 46V 1X 46C Exits:WU> You kneel down and study the ground.
   Your victim's tracks lead up.
   A Rocky Ledge Near the Sea
   Rising sharply behind you, the craggy grey rocks stare silently at the
   heavens, eternally waiting. Far below you, the ragged white surf
   crashes
   rhythmically into the land, dissolving it grain by grain into the fine
   sand
   which has drifted around the narrow ledge at your feet. The rocks above
   are
   slippery but scalable, while the rocks below invite you to a certain
   death.
   Slightly east of you, a shadowed alcove presses lightly into the side
   of
   the cliff.

   A Clifftop Overlooking the Sirrion Sea
   The grass ends here, cut short by a rise of sheer grey rocks to the
   north. A way might be found through the dense forest to the east, but
   otherwise the only exits are to the south along the grass and down the
   rocky cliff to the Sirrion Sea.
