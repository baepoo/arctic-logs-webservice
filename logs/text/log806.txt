   heard. South of you, followers of Takhisis dressed in dark metal armor

   This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
   banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from
   wooden

   The narrow trading street continues to the north, where it leads to the
   docks that provide the town with its revenue. The cry of seabirds is
   carried on the sea breeze, the occasional flash of white in the sky

   east,
   where some wooden stables have been built, while to the west is a
   warehouse.
