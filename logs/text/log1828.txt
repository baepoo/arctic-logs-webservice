   The Crossed Arms
   The low ceiling holds the smoke and noise close to the floor in this
   busy inn. A dozen long tables stand scattered about the room and a
   narrow
   stair in the back leads to the upper floor. Along the south wall, a
   fieldstone hearth holds a rotating spit. Several groups of adventurers
   are
   clustered about the various tables, each eying the others suspiciously
   and
   planning their campaigns in muted tones.

   Vallenwood Lane
   The lane widens into the front yard of a large and comfortable-looking
   inn. The inn seems less to have been built as much as grown from the
   very
   ground between the Vallenwood trunks. At the moment, the trees barely
   reach
   the second story windows, but someday they'll tower over the inn's red
   tile
   roof. A large sign hanging over the entrance creaks slightly as it
   moves in
   the breeze.
   Ichino the Bambino, Sweet Lover in Krite's Bed is standing here.
