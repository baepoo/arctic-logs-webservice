   RQ assists Wilds in smoking us on a frequent basis, good to return the
   favor.

   The Entrance to the Halls of Rage Quitters
   Stone tiles mark this section of the stronghold as impressively sturdy.
   The beautiful rhomboid geometry seen in each tile is distinctive of the
   finest dwarven masonry. From years of use, each tile has taken on a
   polished sheen to make any homeowner proud. The oak walls on the
   hallway
   are kept clean by a variety of custodians, and the ceiling is high with
   a classic skylight window, which at the right time of day can let in a
   fair share of sun.

   A Frosty Path Through Twendle
   This grassy path, etched in deep, white frost, winds its way through
   several huts. Though populated, this village is strikingly quiet and
   the
   barbaric humans that pass you seem apprehensive. Smoke drifts lazily
   by,
   carrying with it the smell of roasting lion meat. Nestled near the
   Khalkists to the north, this village would be in a very precarious
   position
   in the event of an avalanche.

   The Halls of Rage Quitters
   The stench of sweat and grime hits you like a charging remorhaz as
   you enter the room. Not surprising, given how active your clan has been
   lately. It seems like they have single handedly rid Krynn of the last
   of
   the dragons and pulled down all the strongholds of the greatest lords
   and
   leaders. Yet somehow more pop up each day and your Clan fights on to
   bring order and domination to the world. The bright fireplace warms the
   room and provides the light for you to see your way to the bar and
   check
   in desk. Several waiters and waitresses bustle too and fro, bringing
   the
   much needed ale and sustenance to the worn out heroes. A bell hop
   stands
   by the check in desk, ready to stow your gear. The concierge stands by,
   ready to collect your Clan contribution before you head upstairs to
   your
   room and rest.
   You notice some bloody footprints on the ground.

   Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
   sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The
   flames
   are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
   possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall
   seems
   well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets

   the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
   regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will

   you enter the room. Not surprising, given how active your clan has been
   lately. It seems like they have single handedly rid Krynn of the last
   of
   the dragons and pulled down all the strongholds of the greatest lords
   and
   leaders. Yet somehow more pop up each day and your Clan fights on to
   bring order and domination to the world. The bright fireplace warms the
   room and provides the light for you to see your way to the bar and
   check
   in desk. Several waiters and waitresses bustle too and fro, bringing
   the
   much needed ale and sustenance to the worn out heroes. A bell hop
   stands
   by the check in desk, ready to stow your gear. The concierge stands by,
   ready to collect your Clan contribution before you head upstairs to
   your
   room and rest.
   You notice some bloody footprints on the ground.
   A faint blue aura radiates from the walls.

   The Entrance to the Halls of Rage Quitters
   Stone tiles mark this section of the stronghold as impressively sturdy.
   The beautiful rhomboid geometry seen in each tile is distinctive of the
   finest dwarven masonry. From years of use, each tile has taken on a
   polished sheen to make any homeowner proud. The oak walls on the
   hallway
   are kept clean by a variety of custodians, and the ceiling is high with
   a classic skylight window, which at the right time of day can let in a
   fair share of sun.

   A Frosty Path Through Twendle
   This grassy path, etched in deep, white frost, winds its way through
   several huts. Though populated, this village is strikingly quiet and
   the
   barbaric humans that pass you seem apprehensive. Smoke drifts lazily
   by,
   carrying with it the smell of roasting lion meat. Nestled near the
   Khalkists to the north, this village would be in a very precarious
   position

   The

   The Halls of Rage Quitters
   The stench of sweat and grime hits you like a charging remorhaz as
   you enter the room. Not surprising, given how active your clan has been
   lately. It seems like they have single handedly rid Krynn of the last
   of
   the dragons and pulled down all the strongholds of the greatest lords
   and
   leaders. Yet somehow more pop up each day and your Clan fights on to
   bring order and domination to the world. The bright fireplace warms the
   room and provides the light for you to see your way to the bar and
   check
   in desk. Several waiters and waitresses bustle too and fro, bringing
   the
   much needed ale and sustenance to the worn out heroes. A bell hop
   stands
   by the check in desk, ready to stow your gear. The concierge stands by,
   ready to collect your Clan contribution before you head upstairs to
   your
   room and rest.

   Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
   sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The
   flames
   are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
   possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall
   seems
   well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets
   mar
   the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
   regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
   last forever.

   This short corridor running through the stronghold looks rather simple.
   Large paintings are almost covering the whole white brick wall and
   several
   plants that sit on small dark stone pedestals are placed here and there
   all over the hallway. A couple of hardwood benches are roughly shoved
   into
   one of the corners and a few matching tables are standing in front of
   them.

   The Entrance to the Halls of Rage Quitters
   Stone tiles mark this section of the stronghold as impressively sturdy.
   The beautiful rhomboid geometry seen in each tile is distinctive of the
   finest dwarven masonry. From years of use, each tile has taken on a
   polished sheen to make any homeowner proud. The oak walls on the
   hallway
   are kept clean by a variety of custodians, and the ceiling is high with
   a classic skylight window, which at the right time of day can let in a
   fair share of sun.

   A Frosty Path Through Twendle
   This grassy path, etched in deep, white frost, winds its way through
   several huts. Though populated, this village is strikingly quiet and
   the
   barbaric humans that pass you seem apprehensive. Smoke drifts lazily
   by,
   carrying with it the smell of roasting lion meat. Nestled near the
   Khalkists to the north, this village would be in a very precarious
   position

   stone
   with thatched roofs and look rather crude, though stable. Skirting the
   foothills of the Khalkists north of here, many travelers pass through
   this
   village, though not all of them receive a warm welcome. The air is
   quiet
   and peaceful, filled with the distant giggle of laughing children,
   though
   their voices are soon hushed.

   A Frosty Path Through Twendle
   The air is rich with the smell of smoke mixed with that of roasting
   lion meat. The frost relentlessly covers the path, and you see many
   footprints leading east and south. While only a small settlement near
   the
   mountains, many merchants now travel through the barbarian village on
   their
   way to Lantern to the west or Delphon to the north. Most of the
   caravans
   must be forced to travel around the village, though, as this path is
   not
   suitable for wagons.

   Outside the Village of Twendle
   The village of Twendle appears to be a small human settlement nestled
   deep within the heart of these gently rolling foothills. Looking into
   the
   village, you see many men trading and arguing, along with the
   occasional
   mother with a trail of children behind her. The stone huts spew thin,
   black
   wisps of smoke into the cold air. Sparse forest surrounds the
   settlement,
   though the hills are still relatively barren.

   A Narrow Road
   This narrow road winds a treacherous path through these grim foothills.
   The trail is rocky and somewhat unstable, through clumps of pine trees
   and
   the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
   monotonous. Black smoke hangs lazily in the air, most likely coming
   from a
   village you see a little ways west of here. Small hills to the south
   flank
   these rocky hills you travel, while to the north you can make out
   towering
   mountains and impressive foothills.
   <AM> Arconna the Male Minotaur is standing here.
   A large, black vulture circles overhead, perhaps anticipating your

   The Arched Bridge
   The long and narrow bridge sways in the strong circulating winds that
   have come down from the hillsides. The bridge crosses a canyon that is
   deeper than any vallenwood is tall. You can see a cold river flow
   through
   the canyon during the day, and frozen solid at night. The railing is
   about
   five feet high, protecting travellers and their beasts of burden. The
   land
   to the north is hilly, and far off you see the great Khalkist mountain
   range glaring at you, their jagged peaks spearing eagerly at the sky.
   Peering below to the east, you can see the outlines of the Hedge. This
   marks the boundaries of the Silvanesti Forest.

   monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of
   the
   hillsides that you are forced to travel are grassy or covered with
   small
   rocks. The jagged, violent peaks of the Khalkist Mountains sneer at you
   high above to the north.
