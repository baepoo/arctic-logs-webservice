   Fun, we tried to get corpses again and get them when they came after
   us, but they killed me.

   A Cobbled Lane
   As you approach the center of town, the familiar bustling of life
   returns, but much less than you expected. Several draconians wander
   past
   you, sneering and laughing. The drunks lying in the gutter retreat at
   their
   presence. To the east lies the crossroads of Neraka.
   A red silk sash lies crumpled on the floor [3]

   The Entrance to the Halls of MYTH
   Stone tiles mark this section of the stronghold as impressively sturdy.
   The beautiful rhomboid geometry seen in each tile is distinctive of the
   finest dwarven masonry. From years of use, each tile has taken on a
   polished sheen to make any homeowner proud. The oak walls on the
   hallway
   are kept cleanly by a variety of custodians, and the ceiling is high
   with
   a classic skylight window, which at the right time of day can let in a
   fair share of sun.

   The Halls of MYTH
   Hanging from the center of a gold crown molded ceiling is a large
   chandelier burning a beautiful red flame. The flame is the result of
   the
   burning of sodium and some other select chemical compounds, secret to
   the
   pyromancers of Deep Mine. A servant seems to be dusting the ceiling and
   walls on a small step stool. This job must need to be done with some
   regularity, as the adventurers who frequent this stronghold track in
   copious amounts of debris.
