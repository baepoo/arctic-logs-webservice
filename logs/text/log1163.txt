   A Forest Garden
   From the bustle of the town of Neraka you have entered what appears to
   be a slice of an idyllic forest. You can feel the fresh breeze as it
   runs
   through your hair and finally have the time to relax.
   A blue ochre plate lies here.
   (flying) Za Bang is here, resting comfortably on a clump of moss.
   You see a slender elf here, cutting saplings to make them strong.

   Famine tells you 'go'
   299H 24V 6919211X 211C Mem:3 Exits:E>
   Za ponders the meaning of life, love, and the universe.
   299H 24V 6919211X 211C Mem:3 Exits:E> You utter the words, 'hold
   person'
   Za freezes in place.
   299H 24V 6919211X 211C Mem:4 Exits:E>
   Famine comes out of hiding.
   Famine gives his dagger a quick thrust and twist, as he strikes Za in
   the back with it.
   299H 24V 6919211X 211C Mem:4 Exits:E> reply HELD STAB
   Za says 'seriously'
   299H 24V 6919211X 211C Mem:4 Exits:E> You tell Famine 'HELD STAB'
   299H 24V 6919211X 211C Mem:4 Exits:E> ca 'harm'za
   You utter the words, 'harm'
   You grab Za, who screams in pain.
   299H 24V 6919211X 211C Mem:6 Exits:E>
   Za says 'i have nothing'
   299H 24V 6919211X 211C Mem:6 Exits:E>
   Famine annihilates Za with his pierce.
   Famine massacres Za with his pierce.
   Za is dead! R.I.P.
   > PK Mode ENABLED set to CAST 'HOLD P'

   The death cry of Za echoes from somewhere nearby...
