   Amaru and Yoyo die unexpectedly, the non-eyeball-incinerating version.

   503H 97V 1X 0C Mem:3 Exits:SWUD> The Reception
   The reception contains a small desk. A long hall leads behind the desk
   here and you can tell this is where adventurers rest and take time off
   from
   their journeys. A small stairway goes down towards what appears to be a
   lively tavern.
   You see a silver key sitting here on the ground
   A large board with numerous wanted posters tacked on it is here.
   A receptionist sits here doing her nails.
   A man wearing heavy armor is standing here.

   The wonderful smell of spiced potatoes makes your stomach rumble.
   The Inn of the Last Home
   The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
   the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace
   dominates
   one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill
   the
   room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another
   stairway
   leads down to the forest below.
   Greer, Imperial is standing here. (flying)
   A red-haired young lady is wiping down a table here.

   A Small Side Street
   You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
   up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the
   clouds
   above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
   decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the
   tree.
   The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue
   to
   the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching
   the
   ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the
   stairway.
   A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly

   You follow Greer east.
   Northern Avenue
   You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
   through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to
   form
   a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and
   hear
   Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
   east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
   strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at
   the
   edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

   Greer flies south.
   You follow Greer south.
   Solace Square
   Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
   huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
   their
   limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
   clearing
   here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
   spot
   in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
   north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
   huge
   vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some
   sorts.
   A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
   the
   thick limbs which house the guild hall.
   A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.

   You follow Greer up.
   The Solace Adventurer's Guild
   The guild is full of adventurers of all types, who are trying to hone
   and perfect their skills. The walls are covered with racks of weapons
   and
   armour that are used in the training. Huge book cases also fill the
   room,
   containing numerous spell books and scrolls. There are even chests and
   doors that seem to be made specifically for practice by thieves and
   their
   lockpicks. One master of all skills oversees all the training and
   progression here. A small stairway leads down out of the tree and to
   the
   ground below. A hall leads north. The Hall of Justice is to the south.

   adventurers awaiting their turn to worship. A small door leads west.

   Path Through the Settlement
   The main path that leads through the village continues in this area. It
   is lined by towering spires of a reddish color on both sides as it runs
   its
   course, and the base of one such spire lies immediately to the north.
   The
   path itself extends to the west from here. Beyond the settlement on the
   distant horizon, massive mountains can be seen ringing the outer edges
   of
   this lush plant-filled valley.
