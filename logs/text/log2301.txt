Borz & Golgoth Die

POV: Lucia

Log Rating: -1.2222

Golgoth and friends were chillan west of balifore, we form a
group...and kapow!

On a Cool Road
Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanses of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east
towards
the Khurman Sea and south towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to
be
a favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred
circles
near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection
from
the elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of
the
waves of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.
A large tree of ripe apples grows here.
A wooden signpost has been hammered into the ground here.

circles
near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection
from
the elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of
