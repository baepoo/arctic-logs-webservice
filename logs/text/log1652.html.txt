   Cal got spotted chilling out in nopeace inn... and didn't recall

   The Lion and Eagle Inn
   The noble animals that are this inn's namesake are reflected little in
   it. Though the few candles in the room provide only a very dim light,
   it
   appears the inn's common room is in very poor repair. The chairs are
   old
   and cracking, and the surface of the tables are warped. A greasy bar
   stands
   to the south with several filthy mugs RESTING atop its surface. A sweet
   yet
   sickening smell hangs in the air, its source unknown until you notice a
   half-filled bowl of 'food.'
   You see the outline of a life form here, carrying: a tattered purple
   cloak; an iron eyepatch inlaid with emeralds.

   Western Perimeter Road
   This neighborhood of Vingaard is inhabited by few except the peasants
   and the rats. The entire area contains little besides structures that
   are
   old, run down, and severely neglected due the peasants' lack of money.
   Although the Lords do provide adequate food for their citizens, their
   civic
   services are sorely lacking. The cobblestones beneath your feet have
   loosened from their once tight fit, and some have been completely
   knocked
   from the road. To the east stands a filthy building, with a sign
   bearing an
   eagle and a lion out front.

   Western Perimeter Road and Southern Perimeter Road
   The two cobblestone roads of Western Perimeter and Southern Perimeter
   intersect here at the southwestern corner of the city. The city walls
   rise
   high above you as they extend both north and east along the outside
   edges
   of the perimeter roads. The two roads pass through predominately
   residential neighborhoods. Looking north, various dreary looking houses
   crowd the right side of the road, while to the east, the houses on the
   left
   appear to be in a slightly better condition. Pieces of trash litter the
   roads, and a powerful smell emanates from the filthy gutters.

   Southern Perimeter Road
   This section of Southern Perimeter passes through a fairly poor section
   of town. None of the structures that are constructed on the north side
   of
   this road are in very good condition, yet to appear to be inhabitable.
   Pieces of litter slowly fly around on the street as the wind pushes
   them
   along their way. The gutters along the sides of the street are fairly
   filthy, and a rather strong smell emanates from them. To the south,
   Vingaard's city wall rises above you, extending east and west.

   Solamnus Way and Southern Perimeter Road
   The two roads of Solamnus and Southern Perimeter intersect here at the
   base of the town's large wall. The southwestern section of Vingaard
   appears
   to be residential, with mostly lower class families and individuals
   inhabiting the houses that appear along Southern Perimeter. The houses
   on
   Solamnus appear to be kept up a little better, and may belong to some
   middle-class families. A few street lamps are visible along Solamnus
   Way to
   the north, but none can be seen on Southern Perimeter as it makes its
   way
   to the east and west.

   Southern Perimeter Road
   Home to some of Vingaard's poorer residents, the structures in this
   area reflect the poverty of their inhabitants. Few of the buildings
   have
   been kept up very well; most appear quite old and weathered. Pieces of
   trash float around in the streets, congregating mostly in the gutters
   with
   other waste. Peering down the street to the east, you notice that the
   edifices begin to show better upkeep and generally look nicer. To the
   south, Vingaard's city wall rises above you, extending far to the east
   and
   west.

   Southern Perimeter Road
   The peasants of Vingaard inhabit this fairly old section of the city.
   The structures that stand opposite the city wall to the south appear to
   kept up quite a bit better than those to the west. They are constructed
   mostly of wood and a single story, while some are stone and yet others
   are
   two stories. It seems as though the city's Lords have paid to keep up
   this
   part of the city because of its proximity to the main road through
   Vingaard, a bit to the east. Southern Perimeter Road extends far to the
   east and west.

   Southern Perimeter Road
   Buildings along this portion of Southern Perimeter have an odd look to
   them. They appear to be relatively neatly kept, clean, and structurally
   sound, yet have a strange quality. Looking west down the road, the
   structures visible look quite neglected. A quick glance at a face in
   the
   window reveals the presence of poverty. It seems as though the Lords of
   Vingaard have paid keep up the facades of these structures, probably
   due to
   their proximity to Southern Avenue, one of the pain roads through the
   town.

   Southern Avenue and Southern Perimeter Road
   The cobblestone lanes of Southern Avenue and Southern Perimeter Road
   intersect here. A tall stone wall runs the length of the southern side
   of
   the street, and various houses have been constructed along the northern
   side. A faint smell of smoke mixed with various other aromas can be
   sensed
   in the air, apparently coming from the chimneys of the nearby houses.
   Far
   to the north, at the end of Southern Avenue, the tall gates to
   Vingaard's
   central park are visible. A large archway in the wall leads south to
   the
   gates.

   Inside the Gates
   This large tunnel, just behind the keep's gates, travels through the
   thick stone walls. The ceiling above you is curved and supported by
   several
   small arches, and two great arches stand on either end of this tunnel
   where
   they lead out into openness. The road's pavement is made of smooth,
   gray
   cobblestones about the size of your fist. Torches mounted on iron
   brackets
   provide almost all of the light for the tunnel. The air seems
   relatively
   stagnant throughout the tunnel, and mixes only with the fresh outside
   air
   at the ends. The cobblestone road heads north into the town of
   Vingaard,
   and south into the surrounding lands of grain.

   Vingaard's immense iron gates stand directly to the north, where they

   The Tollhouse
   This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
   Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
   A
   road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
   main
   keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
   for
   those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
   table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
   wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
   coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
   Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
   Palanthas,
   north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

   Near a Tollhouse
   The highway runs alongside the west bank of the Vingaard River, below
   the high walls of the city itself. The road is heavily rutted as much
   traffic passes through the area, and the proximity to the river
   moistens
   the ground. To the west lies a small tollhouse, used in days past to
   collect taxes from travellers passing through. Northward the road heads
   to
   the east gate of Vingaard City, and to a ferry crossing the river.

   Eastern Perimeter Road and Eastern Avenue
   The cobblestone lanes of Eastern Perimeter Road and Eastern Avenue
   intersect in this residential area of Vingaard. The city walls rise
   about
   twenty feet into the air, towering over your head as they stretch the
   length of Eastern Perimeter to the north and south. Few things but
   houses
   are visible as you look up and down Eastern Perimeter. The houses do
   not
   appear to be as expensive as some others in Vingaard, but still look
   like
   very comfortable places to live. Eastern Avenue extends west to the
   center
   of Vingaard, while Eastern Perimeter Road heads north and south.

   A very faint but sweet smell hangs in the air here. Best identified as
   the scent of pastries, you realize that the scent originates from the
   bakery just a bit west of here, the smell being carried over by the
   wind.
   The scent adds nicely to the neighborhood, which is fairly plain and
   simple
   but still comfortable. A bit of noise does come in from the north when
   Eastern Avenue crosses, as the wares transported to and from the docks
   pass
   by there in wagons.

   Looking about, you see a mostly quiet neighborhood of Vingaard. With
   neither the bustle of Market nor the elegance and cleanliness of
   Baxtrey,
   this portion of the city is fairly simple. The houses are more or less
   of
   the same design, constructed of wood and overall well maintained. A
   particularly nice example of the houses lies directly to the west, a
   lamp
   shinning brightly in its window.

   Eastern Perimeter Road
   True to its name, this road runs north-south along the eastern edge of
   the city. It passes through a mostly residential neighborhood, with
   many of
   the houses very similar in appearance. It seems fairly quiet.
   Occasionally
   a muffled shout can be heard. It seems as though despite the massive
   wall
   separating, some of the noise from the dock work leaks though. A fresh
   breeze blows in from the northwest, leaving the air fairly pure save
   the
   mouth-watering scent emanating from a few cooking fires.

   Eastern Perimeter Road and The Avenue of the Triumvirate
   The cobblestones of Baxtrey Way flow in from the west, mixing with
   those of Western Perimeter Road at the base of the town wall. The gray
   stones of the wall rise about twenty feet into the air, towering over
   your
   head. To the southwest lies a large stone building with chimneys atop
   its
   roof giving off a black smoke. The smoke can barely be sensed due to
   the
   wind blowing from the northwest. A few houses are visible along the
   western
   side of Eastern Perimeter to the north, while a short distance to the
   south, the road ends at the city walls.

   The eastern perimeter road extends far to the north and a bit to the
   south from here. Along its length run the thick, gray stones of the
   city's
   walls. Glancing around, the walls here seem to be rather dark, and a
   quick
   touch reveals a layer of chalky soot upon them. The cobbles reveal the
   same. A loud clang alerts you to the presence of the city's blacksmith
   just
   to the west. A black plume can be seen escaping from its chimney,
   drifting
   overhead and to the south. The smell is far from pleasant.
