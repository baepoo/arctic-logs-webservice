   POV:

   Log Rating: 2.1429

   Brama shows his supreme mastery of Runglish.

   Welltimat says 'better return our diamonds!'
   You say 'diamonds?'
   Welltimat nods solemnly.
   You say 'from where?'
   Welltimat says 'from rei!'
   You snort loudly.
   You say 'so'
   You say 'you are fighting us'
   You say 'so you can get rei's equipment?'
   You scratch your head.
   You shrug.
   Welltimat says 'well. diamonds were ours'
   You say 'i thought you didn't want any of her equipment'
   You say 'how?'
   You say 'they decayed.'
   Welltimat says 'so, i dont see how its 'rei's equipment''
   You say 'its rented on her character'
   You ponder the meaning of life, love, and the universe.
   You scratch your head.
   Welltimat says 'well. guess it can decay in rent as well!'
   You say 'sure'
   Yair says 'i have it on rethar'
   You say 'do you need your gazer back too?'
   Welltimat says 'no you dont'
   You say 'i have it containered on my level 5 barb'
   Welltimat says 'diamonds on gorre/rei'
   Yair says 'i pkd them'
   You poke him in the ribs.
   Yair pokes himself in the ribs, looking very sheepish.
   Welltimat says 'your gazer. ha'
   You say 'its on my barb'
   You say 'i keep it in my chest for good luck'
   Welltimat says 'well. gerte is cool'
   You roll on the floor in a fit of laughter.
   You say 'so if someone is cool'
   You say 'they can keep equipment?'
   You scratch your head.
   Welltimat says 'let lucas ask for gazer!'
   Welltimat says 'i just want our diamonds back'
   You say 'why not let him ask for diamonds?'
   Welltimat says 'we'll get them anyway :)'
   Welltimat says 'sooner or later'
   You say 'better watch out!'
   Welltimat looks at you and nods solemnly.
   You say 'I could call Nostramazos'
   Welltimat says 'call adepali!'
   You say 'and have him push the pwipe button'
   You say 'adepali doesnt keep it'
   You say 'nostramazos does'
   You say 'adepali is not trustworthy enough'
   You say 'well its good to know the real reason that you are fighting'
   You thank Welltimat heartily.
   Welltimat says 'who is fighting?'
   You say 'grun'
   You say 'skandalini'
   You say 'fluff'
   You say 'troggs'
   You say 'forgot someone'
   You shrug.
   Yair says 'perrin'
   You say 'yeah'
   You say 'him too'
   Welltimat says 'you think we let you kill grun'
   Welltimat says 'and forgive you?'
   You say 'we should let you kill mid?'
   You say 'and forgive you?'
   Welltimat says 'its gruns fault'
   Yair says 'yup!'
   Welltimat says 'not ours'
   You say 'but'
   You say 'if you are type of people'
   You say 'that will let an untitled random someone'
   You say 'then defend them'
   Welltimat smirks.
   You say 'why would we trust any peace with you'
   You shrug.
   Welltimat says 'i personally dont need any peace'
   You say 'kay'
   Welltimat says 'just was offering'
   Welltimat says 'we can talk it out'
   Yair says 'cybersex'
   You say 'oooh'
   Yair rubs Welltimat's back gently. Maybe they need privacy.
   *Suf jumps onto yair's head and starts pumping his dick into his skull.
   Welltimat says 'have fun'
   ----------------------------------------------
   You tell Welltimat 'so i can pass this on to michi, you want to offer
   peace in return
   for the diamonds that she and gorre have?'
   Welltimat tells you 'no. forget it.'
   You tell Welltimat 'kay'
