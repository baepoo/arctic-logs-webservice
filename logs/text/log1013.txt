   Crossing an Old, Covered Wooden Bridge
   The river below can be seen easily through the openings in the warped
   floorboards. The bridge sways and creaks with each step. The structure
   doesn't feel like it will hold for long, maybe a quick run for the end
   would be best. A misplaced step could lead to disaster, so quick
   movements
   should still be calculated movements.
