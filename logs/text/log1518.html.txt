   Shub eats a couple deaths

   POV: Suffering

   Log Rating: -0.9091

   After hunting shub last wipe with a 3-5man action and him escaping
   against all odds, decided to use the brute force this wipe and hunt him
   with 7-9man with good results. These logs have been posted by popular
   demand from people from other clans that didn't believe shub is
   actually killable.
