me know and I'll edit it out and resubmit.) Hey, at least I tried. But

You are at the very centre of this foul town. Crossroads lead to all

of ash that floats through the air.

been made to hide last night's brawl. Obviously, such violence is
commonplace. Looking around, the locals hiss at you and sneer back into
their watered ale. A long bar, once made from fine oak, stands against
the
far wall. The many ales are displayed in their kegs in a corner.
