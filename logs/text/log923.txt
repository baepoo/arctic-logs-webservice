   The Barbarians' Battlefield
   The tall waving grass stands here, as if planted from a far removed
   plain. You can see the barbarian warmaster standing here. The walls of
   this
   place stand like large trees, their bark only slightly tinged with the
   marks of battle, fire and soot. You can see that Guild Road lies to the
   south.
   Mayaw the Male Theiwar Dwarf is resting here. (invisible)
   A brooding guild guard looks around fiercely.
   A fearsome barbarian warrior is here, sharpening his blade in silence.

   Guild Road
   Guild road leads both east and west. To the east are some very large
   buildings and halls, home of apprentices and masters alike. Sounds of
   combat and spell casting are thick in the air.

   Dock Road
   The fresh sea breeze blows cold against your unguarded face, its salty
   odour bringing with it the smell of the fisherman's catch. The deep
   blue
   ocean rolls its waves gently against the wooden jetties and piers. The
   slapping of water on wood is the only sound that can be heard above the
   wailing of hungry sea birds. The road leads along the sea-front,
   passing
   between small boats and rotting wooden shacks that house the hardy
   fishermen.
   A pale woman wearing the armor of the Knights of the Skull lurks here.

   Dock Road
   A this point, Dock Road stretches inland to the east and is bounded by
   the sea to the west. Looking towards the western horizon, you see a
   vast
   expanse of crystal clear blue water. As the road moves inland to the
   east,
   it enters a small residential section where you see a number of badly
   beaten and somewhat dilapidated old houses.
