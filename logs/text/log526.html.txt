   Young Freedom Enforcers try to uphold the law and order in ScumVille
   Kalaman, but to no avail!

   Me and my junior Officer for peace Styxie of the Great Armies of
   Freedom for a ScumFree Kalaman were
   walking in the streets of named town, trying to upkeep the law and
   order. Alas, to no avail were our buffness
   and skills a match for the evil scum BSP's wandering in our territory.
   We did stand long enuff to prove our ideology
   though! Long live Freedom!
