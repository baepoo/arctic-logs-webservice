   On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely
   sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
   mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the
   path,
   too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low
   collection
   of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room.
   The
   path leads to the south and north, where a sickening smell seems to be
   coming from.
