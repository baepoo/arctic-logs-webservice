Festi jumped us, we got our little group together, good execution on
delay.

Solamnus Way and Southern Perimeter Road
The two roads of Solamnus and Southern Perimeter intersect here at the
base of the town's large wall. The southwestern section of Vingaard
appears
to be residential, with mostly lower class families and individuals
inhabiting the houses that appear along Southern Perimeter. The houses
on
Solamnus appear to be kept up a little better, and may belong to some
middle-class families. A few street lamps are visible along Solamnus
Way to
the north, but none can be seen on Southern Perimeter as it makes its
way
to the east and west.

You flee head over heels.
Southern Perimeter Road
Home to some of Vingaard's poorer residents, the structures in this
area reflect the poverty of their inhabitants. Few of the buildings
have
been kept up very well; most appear quite old and weathered. Pieces of
trash float around in the streets, congregating mostly in the gutters
with
other waste. Peering down the street to the east, you notice that the
edifices begin to show better upkeep and generally look nicer. To the
south, Vingaard's city wall rises above you, extending far to the east
and
west.
A pigeon walks about pecking the ground and running from your feet.
