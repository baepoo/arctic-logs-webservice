   Wild vs DM

   POV: Floid

   Log Rating: 3.5000

   Wild kill Bru for no reason so we strike back. Wild win in the end.

   I log on to do a little mudding to learn wild had killed one of us,
   Bru, for no reason.
   So we decide to strike back. The log would have been a lot cooler if
   everyone had stuck
   to the no recall principle.
   Anyway, I ended up suggesting a shitty hidding spot. Probably should
   have just stood
   our ground to begin with.
