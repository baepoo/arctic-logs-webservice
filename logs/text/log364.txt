ReykasRIP

POV: Silage

Log Rating: -0.5454

I ripped Reykas soloing in tant keep, then was chased down for about an
hour. Finally I rented.

The Barracks
These are the barracks of Tantallon Keep, nestled within the guard
headquarters. The room is quite clean and organized, with several large
cabinets where clothes and armor are kept, and a spotless stone floor.
Dozens of bunk beds line the walls throughout the area in order to
accommodate the entire keep garrison. The barracks continue to both the
south and west from here.
The corpse of a Knight of the Crown is lying here.

An iron warchest inscribed with magical runes of protection sits here.
