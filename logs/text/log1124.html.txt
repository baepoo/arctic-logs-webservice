   Office of Lord Michael
   You have entered the office of Lord Michael, High Clerist of the
   Knights of Solamnia. Though finely decorated, you are somewhat
   disappointed
   that the High Clerist would keep so little material goods. A finely
   decorated desk inlaid with steel supports sits in one corner and is
   literally covered in letters and parchments requesting aid from all
   over
   the continent. A large bed sits in one corner and it is immediately
   obvious
   that Lord Michael is dedicated to his work to the point that he lives
   here
   rather than travelling to his home in Palanthas.

   Michael.
