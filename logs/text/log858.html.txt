   You rise up into the dark vortex...
   And are swept into a new world as the skull glows briefly!
   The Multitude of Choices
   You ascend the vortex, expecting death. However, right as you feel the
   life will be ripped from your physical body, the skull below you
   flashes,
   and suddenly everything changes. You are standing at a four way
   junction of
   strange passages. Everything here seems to be pulsing with energy. You
   feel
   as though everything you thought you knew is wrong, and the universe
   you
   lived in was simply a poor copy of this, the universe of dreams. From
   here,
   you can choose either the north, south, east or west.
