   A Smelly Chamber
   A small stream enters from a hole in the rock to the east and flows
   west into a large cavern. This room looks as if it were carved from
   the rock long ago. The chamber extends up about thirty feet to where
   it ends at a small hole, barely big enough for a person to fit through.
   Smelly slime is splattered all over the rock on the floor of the
   cavern,
   apparently having come from the hole in the ceiling. The hole is placed
   in such a way as most of the slime lands in the stream, and that which
   doesn't slowly slides into the stream, as the floor is beveled towards
   the stream. An ancient ladder runs up one of the walls to the ceiling,
   and it looks sturdy enough that one could still climb it safely.
