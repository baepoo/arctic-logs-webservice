   Miller rips

   POV: Dartavian

   Log Rating: 1.0834

   Miller was under the impression that I looted his gear, which Ghetti
   gave to me, and I even gave back to him, but I guess he still hates
   me...

   Miller thinks I looted his eq on purpose and kept it, so he attacks me.
   Few friends are with me and I have help killing them, Talik seems to
   heal a lot....
   Even tho I gave Miller his eq back, he still thinks he can compete with
   me.
