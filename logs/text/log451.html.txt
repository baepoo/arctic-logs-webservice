   Tinotaur's Secret Plan

   POV: Gloucester

   Log Rating: 3.4337

   Only someone as diabolical as a minotaur Italian could come up with a
   plan to entice evils to log and fight: rip every single tank at faldie
   so that enemies can loot, and then catch them with their pants down
   resulting in a massive equipment swap.
