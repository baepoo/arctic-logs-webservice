The Reception
Although this inn does not look very reputable, at least it has warm
beds and anyhow, it is safer than sleeping in the streets of Neraka. A
small counter stands here with a little brass bell, although you should
not
use it for fear that the receptionist gets angry. It looks as if she
has
had a hard day already.

The Seedy Inn
The blood stained floor is evident as soon as you enter. No attempt has
been made to hide last night's brawl. Obviously, such violence is
commonplace. Looking around, the locals hiss at you and sneer back into
their watered ale. A long bar, once made from fine oak, stands against
the
far wall. The many ales are displayed in their kegs in a corner.
Jeering
and shouts can be heard from the backroom to the north.
A large bulletin board is mounted on a wall here.

Nearing the town crossroads, the buildings get bigger and seemingly
better kept. The scorch marks have been replaced with a grubby shade of
white-wash. The sounds of breaking wood can be heard from the inn to

the
only stretch of greenery in Neraka - once. What was obviously a small

has been ruthlessly burnt, signs of campfires and tent markings suggest
that a draconian camp has once been here.

The road cuts through the mighty Khalkists, covered in the prints of

south
towards the dark city of Neraka. The mountain range looms high above,
craggy and barren. Birds of prey can be seen hovering above, waiting
for
the carnage of war. The air is filled with a thick film, possibly
coming
from one of the semi-active volcanoes in the region.

Beside a Deadly Volcano
Bits of ashes blow across the road, emissions from the huge volcano to
the south west. The road skirts the base of the volcano, and its
potholes
become treacherous as they slowly fill up with soft ash and become
hidden.
All around other bare jagged peaks tower about, casting harsh shadows
over
the land.

What road there is disappears in the drifting volcanic ash, so that to
the north only a path remains. To the south, a poorly visible road hugs
the
side of the volcano, curving out of sight. The air is smoky, and every
now
and then a slight tremor shakes the ground under your feet.

skittering over the broken ground. Southwards it hits a steep descent,
promising an easier way further on as it tries to hug lesser slopes.

Through a Narrow Trail
The bleak Khalkists loom around, flaunting their steep, barren slopes
to all who pass by. To the west the road approaches an impossibly steep
cliff, rearing its way skywards at an impossibly steep angle. To the
east
the road descends along a gentle but rugged slope, and promises to drop
a
lot more in short order.

Breaching the Steep Climb
A cliff rises so steeply here that the occasional pebble plunks you on
the head, falling from great heights without even a single bounce. The
road
is literally cut into the side of the cliff, zigzagging up the steep
face.
To the east it descends a bit more, still rocky but with a much gentler
slope.

Atop a Sharp Descent
A stiff breeze is the only thing to the east, as the mountain drops off
sharper than a knife could cut. Far below birds are visible, circling
to
find anything stupid enough to be blown off the mountain. The road
travels
pretty much straight down, zigzagging down a path literally cut out of
the
rock. To the west it stays level a bit, but promises a similar descent.

Crossing a Narrow Trail
The thin air stings your lungs slightly as the high altitude makes
itself known. The road wanders along a narrow ridge heading east.

east, the road goes straight down in a steep descent every merchant
dreads,
easy to walk but a nightmare for any wagon or cart.

Base of a Narrow Climb
Here the road is widened a bit, a staging area for the merchant wagons
that have to brave the steep climb of the road as it heads up into the
mountains. To the west it travels a bit easier, picking its way along
less
steep slopes. A few broken wheels and oxen bones break up the rocky
monotony of the road, showing that not every merchant successfully made
his
way down.

The mountains loom all around, trying to swallow the weary traveler in
their barren vastness. The occasional wind from the north brings the
smell
of smoke, hinting that there may be a town just past a barely visible
pass.
To the east the rocky slopes swallow the road whole, spitting it out
every
now and then as it passes over rocky outcroppings.

The dreary city of Jelek rises before you to the north, past a small
path that leads to the southern gates of the city. The road itself
winds

slopes. The Khalkists loom all around, falling away only to the west.

The mercantile town of Jelek sprawls out to the northeast, various
stone buildings and slaver tents rise above the low protective wall
that
circles the city. The road widens to the east and west, while winding
next
to the crumbling walls to the north. East, the road leads through a
pass in
the Khalkists towards Neraka. West, the way looks less traveled,
leading
off through the badlands to the lands of Throt beyond.

with the cries of slavers and mercenaries moving their slaves about.
The

and the slavers. The buildings are made of roughly hewn stone and clay,
hardly any timber can be seen on the buildings.

Before a Large Town
Just off the main roadway to the east, the wretched bustling town of
Jelek sprawls out in its disgusting filth. The tents of slavers can be
seen
cresting over the low protective wall that encircles the town. Nestled
close to the black beast of the Khalkists, the town looks truly fitting
in
such a dark place. The road leads off to the north, leading through the
badlands. The mountains rise high above eastwards.

You are outside the gates of the city of Kalaman. The large stone walls
rise high above you. From this vantage point you are able to see a few
Solamnic Knights walking about along the battlements. The huge city
gates
are directly north of you and a path skirts the city to the west. There
is
also a long road extending to the south through the plains.

Estwilde spread out beyond the horizon. Crops and wild grasses cover
the
ground. A small road, more of a wagon path, curves around the mighty

Beyond the City of Kalaman
Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two
paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off
to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there
is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

strangely lush and thick in an area where fields are more common. The
wide
path cuts north, further into the widening fields, and south towards a

it makes its way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in
with
sandy dunes. Scattered among the dunes are pieces of driftwood that
have
been washed up over the years from storms off the ocean.

banks
herding the river on its course. On each of the north and south sides
of
the rivers, roads lead through the lands towards Palanthas and the Lord

The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The
northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving
only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains

A Highway Through the Plains
Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches in a general east and west direction, escaping the horizon. A
small grassy pathway branches off the highway here and leads toward the
north. Quiet and depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across
the
highway, their heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless
plains
surround the highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall
plants and weeds. The wind brings a light chill to the air and the
smell of
fire.
