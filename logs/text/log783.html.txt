   Nearing The Top of the Mountain
   The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this
   distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and
   the
   biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life
   anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that
   of
   the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to
   lead
   around the peak of the mountain but it's difficult to ascertain where
   exactly one is in relation to the lower regions of the mountain.

   it.
   The wind blows harder here than anywhere else, its strength is enough
   to
   chill any living creature to the bone. The only sign of life which
   exists
   is a small tent which is miraculously set up atop this peak. A small
   tunnel
   seems to run down the center of the mountain, and turning around, you
   notice the path which lead you here has vanished.

   A Path Around A Mountain

   that seems to be hanging around the mountain. Fierce winds blow causing
   strange noises to be heard everywhere. No life can be seen anywhere,
   this
   place is dead to the world and seems to not to have seen the living in
