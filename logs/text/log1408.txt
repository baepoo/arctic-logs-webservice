   A Grove of Neutrality
   This forest is full of plants and wildlife. Many animals wander around,
   moving inobtrusively through the foliage. You feel protected by the
   natural
   peace that seems to pervade this grove. You think you notice a few
   robed
   men blending almost entirely into the woods.
   The master of nature is here, playing with a small lightning cloud.
   A medium sized horse is here, awaiting a rider.
   A young, strong looking horse stands here stamping his hooves softly.
