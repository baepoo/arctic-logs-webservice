   Kano R.I.P. (long time ago)

   POV:

   Log Rating: 0.0000

   Lilipea (level 8 mage) yells for a duel... and Kano (27ish ranger or
   something) accepts... then gets killed because hes stupid.

   Earlier I had been Yelling for a duel I thought this
   wouldn't work but then I stumbled upon my favorite Idiot
   KANO!
   Also, sorry about the "Anonymous" thing later I didn't
   think they'd like me to tell who it was ;)
