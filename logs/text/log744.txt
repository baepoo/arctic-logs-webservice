room. This is also a very popular place where adventurers sit around
and
share tales of their journeys. Some stairs in the back lead up to the
quarters.
A wooden bulletin board with the heading 'Wanted' is posted on the
wall.

Traveler's Lodge
The lodge is famous for its hospitality and friendly service. The
lodge also has its own cafe, where they make great tasting coffee.
There is
also a lounge for the guests to rest and relax or do some reading. The

Vingaard Avenue South
This is Vingaard Avenue, a well traveled street that runs north-south
through Kalaman. To the north, you see the busy town square and bazaar.
Looking south, you see the poorer part of town, less frequented by the
general populace. The Traveler's Lodge is to the west and a fine diner
is
to the east.

Market Square of Kalaman
This square is the busiest part of the city. People of all kinds walk
the city square of Kalaman. Shoppers, merchants and wagons go through
this
square non-stop all day long. The air is filled with the smell of food,
spice and anything else you can think of. It is almost impossible to
stretch your arms here without hitting something or someone.

Intersection of Market Street and Wall Road
You are at the intersection of Market Street and Wall Road. Market
Street runs east-west through Kalaman, while Wall Road runs along the
inside of the city wall. Market Street is the busiest street in
Kalaman;
many of the shops and stands are located here.

Western City Gates
You are inside the western city gates. The gates are made of thick
wood, reinforced with iron bars, and are very tough to break. The
gateway
is arched, and above you you can see steel bars that can slide down in
case
of siege or attack.

wooden walls rise up beside either side of the gate and block your view
of
Kalaman. Above the gate you can see Solamnic Knights on patrol on the
battlements. Off to the west you can see a trail leading through the
fields.

Beyond the City of Kalaman
Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two
paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off
to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there
is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

Before an Old Cemetery
To the north stands a rusty bronze gate, hanging slightly off its

the western city gates of Kalaman, to the west it leads deeper into the
fields, and toward the river.

Near a Vast City
To the east, across some fields you see the city of Kalaman. You can
smell a farm to your north, easily recognizable by the sweet smell of
manure. Around you grass is blown in the wind, growing thicker as it
leads
into a lush forest to the west.

Beside a Thick Forest
To the east farms spread out across the fields. The air here smells
heavily of manure. Along the eastern side of the trail a wooden fence
has
been set up to protect the fields, while to the west a thick forest,
strangely lush and thick in an area where fields are more common. The
wide
path cuts north, further into the widening fields, and south towards a
large city.

Traveling the Plains
The trail leads through the plains to the north. To the south you can
see farms to the east further down the path, which explains the
horrible
smell in this area. The tall grasses sway gently in the wind, and the
sounds of wildlife are audible.

Walking the Plains of Estwilde
The trail here continues to the north and to the south. To the far
north the Vingaard estuary is just barely visible. All around grass
sways
in the wind gently blowing off the water. The ground at your feet is
slightly barren, as if it has been grazed upon.

Crossing the Plains
Around plains to the north and the south the trail leads. Across the
plains to the north you can just barely see the Vingaard River. The
grass
here is blowing gently in the wind coming off the water. The ground
here is
slightly uncovered as some of the grass appears to have been razed.

Curving Away from the Shore
The trail here heads towards the shoreline of the river, and into the
plains south of here. The river stretches out a little ways north of
you as
it makes its way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in
with
sandy dunes. Scattered among the dunes are pieces of driftwood that
have
been washed up over the years from storms off the ocean.

North of you the river flows past toward the sea in the east. The
shoreline here is sandy with the occasional clump of grass clinging
onto
it. Rocks and small sticks are strewn about, having been deposited here
during the last flood. The trail here is very sandy.

The Banks of the Vingaard River
The road runs to the very edge of the mighty river, before curving away
to the south and east. A small pier has been built along the bank, used
by
passengers boarding the ferry that will carry them to the other side of
the
river. A small signpost has been hammered into the ground beside the
pier.
The road leads south through the Plains of Estwilde and east towards
the
Lord City of Kalaman.
A small wooden signpost stands upright at the edge of the road.

The Vingaard River
The mighty Vingaard river rushes past you as it rushes through the
plains to the south. There is a heavy sent of saltwater to the air,
marking
the estuary of the river to the northeast. The river is thinner here,
banks
herding the river on its course. On each of the north and south sides
of
the rivers, roads lead through the lands towards Palanthas and the Lord
City of Kalaman.

Banks of the Vingaard River
You are standing on the northern banks of the Vingaard river. The
roaring river flows past you, splashing water near your feet. The river
appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As
you
survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from
the
river there is a path heading north.

A Junction of Paths
The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The
northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving
only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains
towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from
the
river there is a path heading north.

329H 131V 0C Mem:1 Exits:NS> The Vingaard River
The mighty Vingaard river rushes past you as it rushes through the
plains to the south. There is a heavy sent of saltwater to the air,
marking
the estuary of the river to the northeast. The river is thinner here,
banks
herding the river on its course. On each of the north and south sides
of
the rivers, roads lead through the lands towards Palanthas and the Lord
City of Kalaman.

The Banks of the Vingaard River
The road runs to the very edge of the mighty river, before curving away
to the south and east. A small pier has been built along the bank, used
by
passengers boarding the ferry that will carry them to the other side of
the
river. A small signpost has been hammered into the ground beside the
pier.
The road leads south through the Plains of Estwilde and east towards
the
Lord City of Kalaman.
A small wooden signpost stands upright at the edge of the road.

329H 125V 0C Mem:1 Exits:NS> Banks of the Vingaard River
You are standing on the northern banks of the Vingaard river. The
roaring river flows past you, splashing water near your feet. The river
appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As
you
survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from

Near the Mighty Vingaard
Here the road leads north to the Vingaard river and Kalaman, and south
to the Dargaard mountains. The fields around here have slightly ragged
looking grass, as if the soil in this area is not optimal for plant
life.
The sounds of wildlife present everywhere else in the plains are
missing
here.

Crossing the Plains
The road here leads across the plains to the north and to the east. Far
to the south you can see the Dargaard Mountains and to the north lies
the
Vingaard river. The road here is made of flat stones carefully placed
in
rows. Closer to the south lie the legendary Nightlund plains.

Crossing the Plains
The road here turns south toward the Dargaard mountains and heads west
and north to Kalaman and the Vingaard river. Around you, grass in
fields
upon fields blows gently in the breeze. The road at your feet is made
up of
flat stones neatly arranged in rows.

Travelling the Plains of Estwilde
The road here extends north and south along a natural dip in the
plains, perhaps an old river once ran through here. The road is made up
of
flat stones neatly arranged in rows and here it appears someone has
made an
effort to correct for the dip in the land by laying an underlayer of
sand
or gravel. The fields around here are gently blowing in the wind.

In Sight of a Small Hamlet
Here the road passes through the plains. South of here lies a small
hamlet, while north of here the road continues to Kalaman and the
Vingaard
river. The road here seems to be made up of gravel laid in a thin layer
to
prevent the grass from growing through, but you can see that in more
than a
few places, grass is peeking through.

329H 109V 0C Mem:1 Exits:NS> Outside A Small Keep
The road splits as a side path leads towards a small hamlet. Atop a
hill to the east, a ruined manor can be seen, its stone charred. To the
northeast a newer keep can be seen. Close to the southeast, the peaks
of
the Dargaard mountains can be seen. The road leads north through the
plains
and west towards the cursed lands of Nightlund.

A Road off the Highway
Walking along a more rural path, you can see the highway to your west.
The path here is covered with leaves, but you see recent signs of
wagons
passing through here. The arid heat of the plains is lessened by the
trees
of a small wooded area covering both sides of the path.

Moving Towards A Village
The rural path continues going an almost straight east west direction,
occasionally skirting around a tree on the outsets of a wooded area.
The
great highway of the plains can be seen to the west. From the east, the
smoke of a few cooking fires can be seen, bringing with their wafting
vapors the smell of fresh cooked mutton.

Before The Village
The road continues just outside a small village. To the west, you can
barely make out the highway. Past the village, two large structures
catch
your attention. One appears to be a manor bearing the kingfisher
insignia
of the Knights of Solamnia. The other appears to be an old keep now
laying
in ruins.
A wooden rake is here, covered by a few leaves. [2]

A Village Path
The village extends to the east. The smell of cooked meat and pastries
comes from the north. Looking south, you see what appears to be a
general
store. you can continue through the village towards the manor, or
return
back to the highway to the west.

A Village Path
Continuing through the village, you hear two different sounds. To the
north comes the steady rythmic beat of a forge, while to the east comes
some strange whirring sounds. You can travel back west, or follow the
village path south.
A wooden rake is here, covered by a few leaves.

A chicken pecks at the ground, searching for food.

Tinker's Workshop
Loud clinging and clanging noises echo deafeningly in the room. Upon
closer inspection, these sounds are coming from several strange
inventions
that only a gnome could fathom. You duck just in time as a tilting
wheelbarrow on a intricate set of pulleys whisks by your head.
