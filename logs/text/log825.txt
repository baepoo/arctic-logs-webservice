Beside the Vingaard
North of you the river flows past toward the sea in the east. The
shoreline here is sandy with the occasional clump of grass clinging
onto
it. Rocks and small sticks are strewn about, having been deposited here
during the last flood. The trail here is very sandy.

The Banks of the Vingaard River
The road runs to the very edge of the mighty river, before curving away
to the south and east. A small pier has been built along the bank, used
by
passengers boarding the ferry that will carry them to the other side of
the
river. A small signpost has been hammered into the ground beside the
pier.
The road leads south through the Plains of Estwilde and east towards
the
Lord City of Kalaman.

Near the Mighty Vingaard
Here the road leads north to the Vingaard river and Kalaman, and south
to the Dargaard mountains. The fields around here have slightly ragged
looking grass, as if the soil in this area is not optimal for plant
life.
The sounds of wildlife present everywhere else in the plains are
missing
here.

the
Vingaard river. The road here is made of flat stones carefully placed
in
rows. Closer to the south lie the legendary Nightlund plains.

Travelling the Plains of Estwilde
The road here extends north and south along a natural dip in the
plains, perhaps an old river once ran through here. The road is made up
of
flat stones neatly arranged in rows and here it appears someone has
made an
effort to correct for the dip in the land by laying an underlayer of
sand
or gravel. The fields around here are gently blowing in the wind.

Here the road passes through the plains. South of here lies a small
hamlet, while north of here the road continues to Kalaman and the

river. The road here seems to be made up of gravel laid in a thin layer
to
prevent the grass from growing through, but you can see that in more
than a
few places, grass is peeking through.

Outside A Small Keep
The road splits as a side path leads towards a small hamlet. Atop a
hill to the east, a ruined manor can be seen, its stone charred. To the
northeast a newer keep can be seen. Close to the southeast, the peaks
of
the Dargaard mountains can be seen. The road leads north through the
plains
and west towards the cursed lands of Nightlund.

The path here is covered with leaves, but you see recent signs of
wagons
passing through here. The arid heat of the plains is lessened by the
trees
of a small wooded area covering both sides of the path.

smoke of a few cooking fires can be seen, bringing with their wafting
vapors the smell of fresh cooked mutton.

catch

insignia
of the Knights of Solamnia. The other appears to be an old keep now
laying
