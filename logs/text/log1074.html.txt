   The end of Greer

   POV: Greer

   Log Rating: 2.0834

   Just read it.

   At one point in time I wasn't a man of my word. I let all of BSD down
   and I'm sorry. I made a couple of promises to some BSD guys actually,
   and I will keep them. It's been a great journey, I've had a blast. For
   those of you who know me I will end with this:
   "Do not follow where the path may lead.
   Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."

   *If you just looked at me without permission, or you aren't a friend,
   *then you just made yourself null and void of any help/assistance you
   *may or may not have gotten from me, from this point in time until the
   *end of existance, on your present character, or any other mutlies you
   *may have now, or any other multies you may or may not have have from
   *here until the end of time.

   *Have a nice day!
