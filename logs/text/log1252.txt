The Hatchery
This room is quite a bit smaller than the cavern directly beneath the
obelisk, yet it is still quite large. Here veins of wine red crystal
ooze
out of fissures in the rock. When the soft crystal touches the warmer,
moister air of the cavern, it lightens to clear crimson and begins to
take
more exact form. All around are dozens of half formed Micones; some
only
heads, some whole bodies but without legs, and some so complete that
their
antennae wiggle.

The Hatchery
This room is quite a bit smaller than the cavern directly beneath the
obelisk, yet it is still quite large. Here veins of wine red crystal
ooze
out of fissures in the rock. When the soft crystal touches the warmer,
moister air of the cavern, it lightens to clear crimson and begins to
take
more exact form. All around are dozens of half formed Micones; some
only
heads, some whole bodies but without legs, and some so complete that
their
antennae wiggle.
The corpse of Ceraq is lying here.
A wide black belt is here.
Deeply scratched gauntlets has been left to lie on the ground.
The corpse of Luze is lying here.
