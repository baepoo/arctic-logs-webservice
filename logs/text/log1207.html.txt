   Luze R(.I.P.)

   POV: Fidlas

   Log Rating: 3.1111

   Luze pk'd Amos, as previous log shows, then used the elite hide-out -
   Flotsam inn. Also used the well-known "I-wont-loose-eq-to-you-suckers"
   trick of eq x-fer.

   Market Street
   A few seagulls cry out from above, searching for food near a lifeless
   sea. An old woman kindly throws them some bread from her house window,
   carefully avoiding the street orphans below. To the west is the local
   bank,
   its small windows barred to prevent any thieves. To the east is a small
   inn
   where weary travellers can stay the night. There is a big wooden sign
   hanging from the building.

   Ronald the Male Human is standing here. (flying) (invisible)

   The Blood Sea Tavern
   The tavern is a rather shoddy watering hole, full of sea faring people
   and sailors from around Krynn. The rough wooden tables and benches have
   been splintered and mended several times, signs of the rough punters
   the
   Tavern serves. Old fishing relics hang from the walls, nets and ropes,
   hooks and floats. Paintings of heroic captains, daring to brave the
   maelstrom, hang above the bar. Taking pride of place is a large map of
   Istar and Flotsam on the far wall.
   A tin hooded lantern has been left here.
