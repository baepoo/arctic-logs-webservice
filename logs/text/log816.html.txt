   You are just off the main road leading west to Delphon. The more
   developed road to the north bears most of the traffic in the area. The
   few
   travelers on this road mutter quietly to themselves about that cursed
   city
   of infidels. The city of Delphon is plainly visible to the west, but
   the
   track off the main road just disappears south among the sand.

   A Dry Old Road
   This large road, composed mostly of dry, dusty dirt, winds its way
   across the parched yellow grasses of the plains towards Delphon to the
   west, and to a crossroads east of here. The wind carries with it the
   sounds
   of Delphon, a large city whose towering gates glitter in both darkness
   and
   light. Many travelers pass you by, most heading west towards Delphon or
   beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests southeast of here, along
   the
   shores of the Khurman Sea. A small path runs to the southwest, skirting
   around the possible dangers of Delphon.

   Intersection of Alan Ak-Khan
   Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are
   usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down.
   This
   crossroads is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and
   merchants
   alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits
   on
   the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
   Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no
   wonder
   that bandits frequent these roads.
   A small grove of trees thrives just off to the side of the road.
