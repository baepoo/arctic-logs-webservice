   Path of the Holy
   This is a small north-south path that takes you to the temple of
   Kalaman. The minute you walk through the city gates, you can see the
   magnificent structure of the temple, an ivory white building standing
   tall
   and proud in a large city. The entrance to the temple is just to the
   west,
   while to the north, you see the entrance to a quiet and peaceful park.
   You
   can also go a bit south, and reach the busy market street.
   A tiny, shimmering faerie hovers near you.
