A Path Around A Mountain
The path continues around the backside of the mountain but the east
side of the mountain is not distinguishable from the west side of the
mountain. The upper regions of the mountain are blocked by a thick fog
which seems to hang over the peak. Fierce winds howl throughout the
mountain giving it a greater sense of foreboding. There is no life
anywhere
on the mountain just a few beaten paths that do not appear to have seen
the
lines of the living for quite some time.

The bleak looking mountain shoots up into the air, seeming to pierce

this

The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this

increase in frequency before turning into a magnificent forest. While
to
the east, small rocks and boulders cast off from the mountain in the
distance litter the road, making travel difficult.

Before an Ancient Forest
The thick brush and large, ancient trees surrounding the path grow even
thicker farther west. The forest is alive with the movement of
creatures,
small and large alike, scurrying through the underbrush and across the
treetops. To the east stand the northern gates of Old Tarsis, and a
majestic mountain on the horizon.
A man stands here, ready to prepare you for the tournament.

130H 138V 0C Exits:EW> Amidst an Ancient Forest
This part of the forest is filled with ancient trees that predate the
Cataclysm. They leap out of the ground, rising as high as three hundred
feet. To the north and west the trees are so densely packed that you
have
trouble making out what lies beyond them.

An Intersection Amongst the Trees
The path you were on branches off in three directions at this small
intersection. Animals can be heard scampering through the treetops and
every so often you catch a glimpse of a very large blur running past
your
peripheral vision.
130H 132V 0C Exits:NSW> s
A Forest Path
The fresh air invigorates you, as you pause a moment to decide in which
direction you will embark. Towards the west, the forest seems to be
brighter than it is towards the north or the south.
130H 129V 0C Exits:NSW> s
A Worn Footpath
The path continues running in the north south direction, leading deeper
into the forest. The path seems to be decently well-trodden relative to
other parts of the forest. It's as if there has been a decent amount of
foot traffic here of late.
130H 126V 0C Exits:NSW> s
A Turn in the Path
Just when you think the path must dead end, you notice that it takes a
quick turn towards the north. It is impossible to tell how much farther
the
forest continues on for, but you reason that it can't continue on
forever,
can it?
130H 123V 0C Exits:NW> w
A Small Path between the Trees
The path is small and overrun with stray branches. Huge trees tower up
all around you, blocking the sky from your view. As with much of the
forest
there is a canopy of leaves and branches above you, cooling the forest
off,
and soaking up the heat of the sun. There is an eerie calm to the
forest,
and it is reminiscent of the eye of a hurricane.
130H 120V 0C Exits:NEW> w
A Split in the Path
The paths splits here, one leading to the north towards the heart of
the forest, the other leading to the east into the interior of the
forest.
Huge trees tower over everything, dwarfing all other entities in the
forest. As always the ever persistent canopy blocks out anything but
that
which dwells under its protection. The forest seems to be a world unto
itself, trapping those within it for its own ends.

A Path in the Forest
The path seems to lead deeper into the forest, there's a stillness in
the air as though violence can erupt at any moment. The silence is
pervasive yet somehow comforting. Huge trees tower over the forest
floor.
One can only wonder at their age but clearly they most predate the
cataclysm. The forest is thick and very little light filters through
the
trees.

Before an Ancient Forest
This small path is surrounded by trees that grow thicker to the north
as it moves into a dark forest. The ancient trees reach high into the
air,
their wide trunks surrounded by healthy shrubbery. The path to the
south
leads toward the western gates of Old Tarsis.
Helion Wreckor, Dealing the Damage is standing here.
Santino, the Prodigal Son is standing here.
Martinez is standing here.
