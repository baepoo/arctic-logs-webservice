Inside the Gates
This large tunnel, just behind the keep's gates, travels through the
thick stone walls. The ceiling above you is curved and supported by
several
small arches, and two great arches stand on either end of this tunnel
where
they lead out into openness. The road's pavement is made of smooth,
gray
cobblestones about the size of your fist. Torches mounted on iron
brackets
provide almost all of the light for the tunnel. The air seems
relatively
stagnant throughout the tunnel, and mixes only with the fresh outside
air
at the ends. The cobblestone road heads north into the town of
Vingaard,
and south into the surrounding lands of grain.
You sense a life form.
Quakc ity, the Generic M.D. is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
(white aura)
. . . has a tough exterior.

Before the South Gates of Vingaard
Vingaard's immense iron gates stand directly to the north, where they
present a significant obstacle to any attacking force, but currently
they
have been raised high to allow passage of people and horses. High stone
walls run east and west from here, extending quite a ways before
turning
beyond your vision. A road heads south where it quickly turns and heads
west, passing the toll station as it travels through fields of grain,
and a
cobblestone avenue heads north through the gates.
You sense a life form.

The Tollhouse
This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.

The Knights' High Road
The Knights' High Road ends here, just west of the city of Vingaard.
The city's massive town wall surrounds the city just to the northeast,
while perched atop a hill to the southeast is the main keep, and
impressive
fortification. Large swatches of fertile farmlands surround the town,
and a
small road leads off to the north through them. Directly to the east is
a
small two-story stone structure, the tollhouse, used to collect taxes
from
people passing through the area.
