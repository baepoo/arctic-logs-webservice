   MINES OF LOK' TATH
   ==================
   BACKGROUND:
   Recently, a travelling bard has been seen frequenting the Palanthian
   inn
   and has been telling stories of the fabled mines of Lok' Tath.
   According to
   the bard, the ancient mines were originally the home to a group of
   stalwart
   dwarven miners. Realizing the enormous wealth the mine was capable of
   providing, the miners enlisted the help of a group of renegade magi to
   provide protection for the mines and the little village the dwarves had
   established in the nearby mountains. The mages cast powerful spells of
   protection and warding on the area ensuring the safety of the miners.
   Years
   passed and the miners grew rich from working the mines. However, for
   some
   unknown reason, the miners slowly began to lose their mind. Whether due
   to
   the years of isolation or the constant subjection to the powerful
   magics,
   the miners eventually killed themselves off in mindless rage. The area
   has
   been deserted for over two hundred years. However, the bard claims to
   have
   seen traffic along the road leading to the ancient village.
