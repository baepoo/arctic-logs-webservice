   395H 31V 10587726X 5082C Exits:NES> The Big Tankard'd Wench
   This dark tavern is populated by many folk you'd hate to be in an alley
   alone with. The tavern's patrons seem to be of Palanthas's lower
   working
   class. There is a bar along the north wall and a doorway on the south
   wall.
   A travelling bard is here enjoying the sights and sounds of the city.
   Balsac is here wiping out a tankard with a filthy rag.

   395H 27V 10587726X 5082C Exits:NES> A Desecrated Shrine
   This cold room, made of dark stone, appears vacant and abandoned. A
   broken altar is the focal point of the area, with the dark insignia of
   Takhisis still viewable upon it. Whoever once held these grounds must
   have
   fallen out of favor with the authorities, to have it so completely
   demolished, with no return.
