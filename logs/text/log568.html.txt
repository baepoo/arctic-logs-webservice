   Gun and DON'T RUN

   POV: Teri/Denise

   Log Rating: 2.5556

   After succesull hit on Junumuj/Lianois poor killers noticed us logging
   after them and ran into hide spot, leaving it open diff way due to lack
   of game knowledge. Thus died. It cases BSP mass log to hunt us, but we
   used hide spot where Lenore/Bienca died well and just sat there then
   rented. Without a hope to kill us, BSP rent as well but stupid Zar
   decides log to transfer cash and dies due to flag. Clap clap.

   A bundle of black cloth, radiating evil, is here...it glows blue
   A small loop of black leather is barely visible in the shadows here.
   (invisible)..it glows blue
   An ancient tome lies upon the ground, radiating pure evil...it glows

   You get a blackened tome.
   You get the corpse of Zar.
