   Every movement you make is echoed in this dark cavern. The walls are
   roughly hewn but the floor is polished smooth. The air is musty and
   heavy
   with the smell of death. The cavern leads in three directions here,
   north,
   east and west. All lead into darkness and mystery.
   A pile of shimmering green cloth lies in a heap...it glows dimly
   The corpse of Ecko is lying here.
   The corpse of Ri is lying here.
   The corpse of Cicero is lying here.
   An arrow pointing west floats nearby...it glows blue..it glows dimly
   You see the outline of a life form here, carrying: a crimson cloak
   inlaid with threads of marble; a blood red cape.
   Rascal the Male Wild Elf is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
   Armas Ahma is standing here. (flying)
   . . . has a metallic luster.
   Rezo Redge, Hound of the Wildlaw Hunt is standing here. (flying)
   Jaxis Fireforge, Outlaw Brother in Blood is standing here. (flying)
   Rafal the Male Human is standing here. (flying)
   Foll the Male Hylar Dwarf is RESTING here. (flying) (invisible)
   . . . has a metallic luster.
   Sambo Ahma, Number Five is standing here. (flying)
   Chappa the Female Hylar Dwarf is standing here. (flying)
