   Karma

   POV: Padme

   Log Rating: 2.4935

   Renshai made an SF player walk into a death trap for peace since he was
   didn't have gear and he had nothing to offer to them in exchange.
   [*Editor's Note: Some may call it the Finnish Revenge. Although they
   usually demand deletion as well. *] I found that the most degrading
   thing anyone could make someone go through so he could continue to play
   the game we all enjoy. Some people branded me an asshole, I simply call
   it Karma. Players, enemy or not, are people as well and should be
   treated with respect.
