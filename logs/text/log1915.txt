   A Long Dungeon Passage
   The corridor runs long till it abruptly ends into a wall of rocks. The
   ceiling has collapsed. The huge boulders are blocking the corridor very
   efficiently. By no means you are able to re-open this passage. A little
   before the collapsed part of the corridor there is a small alcove in
   the
   north wall. Inside the alcove there is a statue, about the size of a
   man.
   Arork D'orc, Honorary Servant of Sargas is standing here. (flying)
   <Newb> Huck the Male Gnome is standing here. (flying) (invisible)

   An Ancient Tomb
   A thick layer of dust covers the bare rock floor. No ornaments of any
   kind are brought here to honor the dead. The walls are rough and solid
   rock. The only object is the gigantic stone sarcophagus at the far end
   of
   the room. Up on the sarcophagus there is a statuette which pictures an
   elderly warrior with a dragon crest and a long Solamnic mustache.
   A delicious slice of birthday cake lies on the floor, abandoned. [14]
