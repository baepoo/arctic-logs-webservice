   Solace Square
   Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
   huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
   their
   limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
   clearing
   here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
   spot
   in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
   north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
   huge
   vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
