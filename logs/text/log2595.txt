By the Black Idol
You step down out of the forest into a grassy, bowl-shaped depression.
The colors dance and weave before you, twisting in the breeze like a
jigsaw
put together by a man who is both blind and insane. You can feel the
eyes
of a thousand woodland stalkers upon your back as the sky before you
darts
and weaves like a drunken insect. You seem to have reached the source
of
both the humming and the drums, and, as the chaos around you
momentarily
assumes the semblance of order, you can make out a large black altar at
the
heart of the depression.
A copper bowl rests by the altar, to receive offerings to the gods.

The Valley Floor

somewhere close by, you can make out a loud, steady humming, which is
occasionaly counterpointed by the beating of many drums, in a rising

reptiles, and the signs of their passage are obvious.
