As you look at this young knight, you immediately notice that its armor
is
not something it is wearing but is instead part of its body. The
pinkish
crystal of the armor covers its entire frame, but moves easily as it
moves.
You can see no sign of a face behind its visored mask, but you feel
confident that it would be the face of goodness.
A young aurinite is in an excellent condition.
