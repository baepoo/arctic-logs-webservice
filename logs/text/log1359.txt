   A Frosty Path Through Twendle
   The air is rich with the smell of smoke mixed with that of roasting
   lion meat. The frost relentlessly covers the path, and you see many
   footprints leading east and south. While only a small settlement near
   the
   mountains, many merchants now travel through the barbarian village on
   their
   way to Lantern to the west or Delphon to the north. Most of the
   caravans
   must be forced to travel around the village, though, as this path is
   not

   The grassy path, covered in a blanket of thick frost, winds its way

   civilized. Smoke drifts idily across your path from one of the thatched
   roofs, carrying with it the tantalizing scent of roasting lion meat.

   few

   A Frosty Path Through Twendle
   This grassy path, etched in deep, white frost, winds its way through
   several huts. Though populated, this village is strikingly quiet and
   the
   barbaric humans that pass you seem apprehensive. The huts are made of
   stone
   with thatched roofs and look rather crude, though stable. Skirting the
   foothills of the Khalkists north of here, many travelers pass through
   this
   village, though not all of them receive a warm welcome. The air is
   quiet
   and peaceful, filled with the distant giggle of laughing children,
   though
   their voices are soon hushed.
