On druidic wings we charge in and ambush bsp.

POV: Fidlas

Log Rating: 1.3000

Fast ambush, few deaths.

Stimpson utters some strange words.
Stimpson vanishes in an opaque fury of wind and air.
Kalabalik vanishes in an opaque fury of wind and air.
A violent vortex of wind forces your gaze skyward.
Suddenly you notice you're somewhere else.
Northern Reach
Just slightly off the main road, this area is home to a large stone
monolith of epic proportions. Ancient druidic runes scour the area and
blanket it mercilessly. The warm glow of trees and foliage suggest a
great
amount of natural health in this secluded spot.
Kalabalik the Outlaw, Cold-hearted Murderer from Ii is standing here.

In View of the Mountains
The road here leads atop a grassy dune. In the distance you can see
mountains, blurry in the heat. A small village is stretched out south
of
here, and an intersection of roads is off west and south. Along the
road
small yellow flowers are growing. Far to the east of here you can see
the
ocean, while closer to the east is a small secluded grove.

Before A Crossroads
The road leads south toward a junction of roads and east toward the
village of Volger. Grass is blown gently in the wind off the sea far to
the
west. Yellow flowers enclose the road in a bright border. Sand is
intermixed with the cobblestones that make up the road. A large flat
stone
sits north of here.

A Junction of Paths
The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The
northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving
only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains
towards
the distant city of Palanthas.
A solemn knight of the sword patrols the area for draconians. (white

South of A Junction of Paths
North of here you can see a junction of roads. South of you lies the
Vingaard river and the ferry that leads across it. Around you the
fields
blow in the wind, and small animals scurry around. The road here is
made up
of rocks stacked together neatly.

Banks of the Vingaard River
You are standing on the northern banks of the Vingaard river. The
roaring river flows past you, splashing water near your feet. The river
appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As
you
survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from
the
river there is a path heading north.

The Vingaard River
The mighty Vingaard river rushes past you as it rushes through the
plains to the south. There is a heavy sent of saltwater to the air,
marking
the estuary of the river to the northeast. The river is thinner here,
banks
herding the river on its course. On each of the north and south sides
of
the rivers, roads lead through the lands towards Palanthas and the Lord
City of Kalaman.

The Banks of the Vingaard River
The road runs to the very edge of the mighty river, before curving away
to the south and east. A small pier has been built along the bank, used
by
passengers boarding the ferry that will carry them to the other side of
the
river. A small signpost has been hammered into the ground beside the
pier.
The road leads south through the Plains of Estwilde and east towards
the
Lord City of Kalaman.
A small wooden signpost stands upright at the edge of the road.

Beside the Vingaard
North of you the river flows past toward the sea in the east. The
shoreline here is sandy with the occasional clump of grass clinging
onto
it. Rocks and small sticks are strewn about, having been deposited here
during the last flood. The trail here is very sandy.

Curving Away from the Shore
The trail here heads towards the shoreline of the river, and into the
plains south of here. The river stretches out a little ways north of
you as
it makes its way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in
with
sandy dunes. Scattered among the dunes are pieces of driftwood that
have
been washed up over the years from storms off the ocean.

Crossing the Plains
Around plains to the north and the south the trail leads. Across the
plains to the north you can just barely see the Vingaard River. The
grass
here is blowing gently in the wind coming off the water. The ground
here is
slightly uncovered as some of the grass appears to have been razed.
A small grasshopper sits in the grass.

Walking the Plains of Estwilde
The trail here continues to the north and to the south. To the far
north the Vingaard estuary is just barely visible. All around grass
sways
in the wind gently blowing off the water. The ground at your feet is
slightly barren, as if it has been grazed upon.

Traveling the Plains
The trail leads through the plains to the north. To the south you can
see farms to the east further down the path, which explains the
horrible
smell in this area. The tall grasses sway gently in the wind, and the
sounds of wildlife are audible.

Beside a Thick Forest
To the east farms spread out across the fields. The air here smells
heavily of manure. Along the eastern side of the trail a wooden fence
has
been set up to protect the fields, while to the west a thick forest,
strangely lush and thick in an area where fields are more common. The
wide
path cuts north, further into the widening fields, and south towards a
large city.

Near a Vast City
To the east, across some fields you see the city of Kalaman. You can
smell a farm to your north, easily recognizable by the sweet smell of
manure. Around you grass is blown in the wind, growing thicker as it
leads
into a lush forest to the west.

Before an Old Cemetery
To the north stands a rusty bronze gate, hanging slightly off its
hinges. Stretching to either side of it stands an old rickety fence
surrounding what appears to be a graveyard. To the east the trail leads
to
the western city gates of Kalaman, to the west it leads deeper into the
fields, and toward the river.

Beyond the City of Kalaman
Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two
paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off
to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there
is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.
