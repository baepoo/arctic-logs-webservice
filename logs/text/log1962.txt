   A Small Clearing in the Park
   This is an open area in the park. All the small paths converge here in
   front of the entrance to a small shrine. The shrine is dedicated to
   nature
   and the life it supports. There is a small archway leading into the
   shrine.
   A white marble fountain spring is in the middle of the clearing.
