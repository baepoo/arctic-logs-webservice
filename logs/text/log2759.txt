The Tree of Z'vil'n
The very first thing that encompasses your vision is the sight of a
gigantic tree. You can feel the enormous power that radiates from this
monument of nature. It seems that the glowing which has filled this
grove
has come from this single tree. Several grey clad Vry-kith can be seen
wandering about, chanting in their insectoid voices. Some runes are
carved
into the face of the tree.
A headband with assorted feathers stuck in it lies here.
A recruit stands here practicing his bash skill. (flying)

A lithe mantis stands before you, chanting softly to herself.
The master druid of the vry-kith stands in quiet meditation.
