   Jenks flies in from the north.
   Approaching the Hills of Khuri-Khan
   A cool breeze blows in from the east where you can see the Khurman Sea
   a ways off. The road becomes much larger here and to the north while to
   the
   southeast it almost becomes buried in tall grasses. To the northwest
   you
   can see the hills of Khuri Khan. The road skirts the sides of these
   rolling
   hills which eventually merge with the lower, warmer hills of the
   Ek-Khan.
   Jenks the Male Human is standing here. (flying)

   Jenks flies in from the east.
   On a Cool Road
   Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanses of grasses is this cool
   road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east
   towards
   the Khurman Sea and south towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to
   be
   a favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred
   circles
   near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
   provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection
   from
   the elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of
   the
   waves of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.
   A large tree of ripe apples grows here.
   A wooden signpost has been hammered into the ground here.
   Jenks the Male Human is standing here. (flying)
   . . . has a metallic luster.
   Nagini the Female Theiwar Dwarf is standing here. (invisible)
   Rocco the Male Human is standing here.
   . . . is outlined with a dim aura.
   A beautiful white horse with majestic wings roams the area.
   A kender bard rests in the shade of an apple tree here.
   A buckskin gelding is tethered here.
