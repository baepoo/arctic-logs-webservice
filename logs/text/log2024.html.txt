   Farewell for a while/forever! BSP sucks.

   POV: Cameron

   Log Rating: -0.0000

   Never trust a BSP. Especially when they seem to be acting friendly and
   reasonable all of a sudden. LIES.

   Well...there's a good chance that this is it for Cameron...
   I've killed 15-17 BSP's and logged about 8-9 of them, but in this log,
   I challenge Crispen to a duel outside Kal west gate..he tells me that
   there is absolutely nobody that is going to help him out after I ask
   him
   several times. I say cool it will be a fun fight. After fight he goes
   opt busy.
   Basically BSP, I dominated you single-handedly, and you have to lie and
   cheat
   to beat me. You guys constantly talked shit, called me lucky, called me
   a cheater,
   even claimed I was getting help from the imms...all this is flattering.
   PEACE.
   And Chivas, WTF man, I gave MAEL great items that I looted from BSP and
   you guys
   gladly accepted them. Thanks!?
