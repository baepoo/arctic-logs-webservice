   A Dark Corridor
   The hallway bends here, heading east and far to the south. The walls
   and ceiling are made of the same dark gray stones that are
   characteristic
   of the citadel. An uncomfortable silence hangs heavily in the air,
   mixed
   with a sense of a prevalent evil. The air is warm, but seems stale and
   dusty. Very few candles are used to light the room, and as a result,
   the
   light is very dim.

   A Dark Corridor
   The dark hallway extends to the north and south from here. The ceiling
   of dark stones is about eight feet high, and is supported by arches
   approximately every fifteen feet. The dim lighting provided by the
   candles
   on the wall is sufficient only for seeing objects up close. At a
   distance,
   there is little more than the presence of darkness to mark where
   someone or
   something is. Faint screams seem to occasionally echo through the
   corridor,
   piercing the eerie silence.

   The Brigadier General's Office
   This large room is illuminated primarily by a large crystal chandelier
   that hangs down from the dark stone ceiling. A large desk made of solid
   oak
   rests in the center of the room, facing the large door to the west. A
   large
   chair sits behind the desk, and two smaller chairs sit in front.
   Bookcases
   along the walls contain numerous volumes of logs and other information.
   A
   fireplace is set into the eastern wall, warming the large room.

   A terrible stench permeates through the room, overwhelming your

   tables each. The room extends to the east, with the door you entered

   has

   stale.

   A Shrine to the Dark Queen
   A small room just off the side of the foyer, this shrine is dedicated
   to the Dark Queen, Takhisis. Lighting is minimal, what little there is
   shines onto the lower half of a large statue of a five-headed dragon,
   located at the center of the room. The shadows cast across the dragon's
   features produce a most terrifying effect, almost bringing the
   malevolent
   form to life. A strange smell hangs in the air, reminiscent of decaying
   flesh. Dark, powerful energy almost seems to flow from the statue, the
   hand
   of Takhisis reaching out.

   Before the Iron-banded Doors
   This small passageway between the north tower and the staircase
   leading to the second floor ends at two large doors. The doors set into
   the
   western wall are made of thick wooden beams set vertically. Large bands
   of
   black iron cross the wooden beams horizontally, and are fastened to the
   door with large bolts. The stones around the door are all weathered and
   gray, much like the ones in the wall to the south, but the viscous
   mortar
   between them does not seem to drip down over the doorway.

   Inside the Stronghold
   Hallways from the north and the west converge here, and a set of two
   large doors leading to the outside has been set into the east wall. The
   walls and hallways are made of dark gray stones much like the outside,
   but
   they lack the old, weathered look. The mortar holding the stones
   together
   is solid and hard. Sconces with burning candles are sparsely placed
   along
   the walls, and provide only weak light.
   A small puddle forms as a piece of ice slowly melts away.
   A pinch of powdered cuprite is lying on the ground.

   A Dark Corridor
   The hallway bends here, heading east and far to the south. The walls
   and ceiling are made of the same dark gray stones that are
   characteristic
   of the citadel. An uncomfortable silence hangs heavily in the air,
   mixed
   with a sense of a prevalent evil. The air is warm, but seems stale and
   dusty. Very few candles are used to light the room, and as a result,
   the
   light is very dim.

   Inside the Stronghold
   Hallways from the north and the west converge here, and a set of two
   large doors leading to the outside has been set into the east wall. The

   they lack the old, weathered look. The mortar holding the stones
   together
   is solid and hard. Sconces with burning candles are sparsely placed

   the

   of
   black iron cross the wooden beams horizontally, and are fastened to the

   Northwestern Corner of the Courtyard
   The citadel's main complex lies to the west while the newer looking of
   the two towers rises to the north. The dark stones of the main complex
   look
   much older than those on the north tower, and lack the slight
   shimmering
   quality. The air is very cold and thin from the high altitude, making
   breathing tough, and a great feeling of evil hangs in the silence.

   Southeastern Corner of the Courtyard

   turns

   the

   A large stone wall encloses the east side of the courtyard. The wall

   Center of the Courtyard
   The great citadel of Galan Dracos surrounds the courtyard on all sides
   but the east, its two large towers rising into the sky. The ground
   beneath
   your feet is made of very dark, almost black cobblestones. Most of the
   citadel including the southern tower looks old and weathered, but the
   northern tower looks much newer. The air is cold and fresh, and it is

   quiet as few creatures dare venture near this horrid place.

   Climbing a Huge Flight of Stairs
   The immense staircase of smooth, dark stone ascends from the east to
   the entrance of the second floor on the west. A thick banister of
   smooth
   black granite lines the sides of the stairs on each side, going from
   the
   courtyard to the second floor entrance. At the base of each of the

   A Shrine to the Dark Queen
   A small room just off the side of the foyer, this shrine is dedicated
   to the Dark Queen, Takhisis. Lighting is minimal, what little there is
   shines onto the upper half of a large statue of a five-headed dragon,
   located at the center of the room. The shadows cast across the dragon's
   features produce a most terrifying effect, almost bringing the
   malevolent
   form to life. A strange smell hangs in the air, reminiscent of decaying
   flesh. Dark, powerful energy almost seems to flow from the statue, the
   hand
   of Takhisis reaching out.

   A Dark Corridor
   The dark hallway extends to the north and south from here. The ceiling
   of dark stones is about eight feet high, and is supported by arches
   approximately every fifteen feet. The dim lighting provided by the
   candles
   on the wall is sufficient only for seeing objects up close. At a

   there is little more than the presence of darkness to mark where
   someone or

   A Shrine to the Dark Queen
   A small room just off the side of the foyer, this shrine is dedicated
   to the Dark Queen, Takhisis. Lighting is minimal, what little there is
   shines onto the lower half of a large statue of a five-headed dragon,
   located at the center of the room. The shadows cast across the dragon's
   features produce a most terrifying effect, almost bringing the
   malevolent
   form to life. A strange smell hangs in the air, reminiscent of decaying
   flesh. Dark, powerful energy almost seems to flow from the statue, the
   hand
   of Takhisis reaching out.
