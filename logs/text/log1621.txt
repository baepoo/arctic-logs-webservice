Cemetery
Old headstones in ragged rows run in all directions here. The grass
below your feet has become parched with time and the curse that was
laid
upon the cemetery. Many trees grow around you, their branches
intermingling
and blocking out the sky above you. Shadows cast by the trees dance
around
you and you see shapes moving about out of the corner of your eye.
Oddie Ball is standing here.
A raccoon scurries about among some tombstones.

The death cry of Oddie echoes from somewhere nearby...
You stop following Oddie.
