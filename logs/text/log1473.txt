   Sapp RIP

   POV: Obeah

   Log Rating: -0.7000

   Sapp tells you 'let me get my sheaf' You tell Sapp 'I just coned you
   out of this sheaf'

   Path of the Holy
   This is a small north-south path that takes you to the Temple of
   Kalaman. The minute you walk through the city gates, you can see the
   magnificent structure of the temple, an ivory white building standing
   tall
   and proud in a large city. The temple is just to the northwest, and
   Market
   Street is to the south.
   A small dagger has been left here.
   Sapp the Male Gnome is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
   . . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.
