Entrance to the Temple of Paladine
Twin staircases of white marble descend to the north and south, meeting
the roads that run parallel to the ancient structure. Gates of crafted
platinum stand to the east, the symbols of the great God Paladine upon
them. The white marble of the columns, walls, and roofs all show signs
of
heavy weathering, a result of the neglect and abandonment suffered in
the
years after the cataclysm. Though neglected, the temple does not appear
to
have been vandalized. A small garden blossoms to the west, while the
gates
lead within the temple.
