   Delphon Cacti Gardens. A stone arch to the north delineates the
   beginning

   Phren Lane is constantly aswirl with passersby here. Many military
   uniforms pass through, both hurrying to duties on the ramparts of the
   gates
   and slowing to peer in at the magistrates in the guard headquarters to
   the
   south. The Dragonarmy soldiers amuse themselves by pausing to taunt
   those
   sworn to protect the merchant interests of Delphon.

   Traffic streams through this main artery of Delphon when the sun is up
   and when the sun is down. Many are heading into the merchants' bazaar
   to
   the south. The poor enter to beg or steal or exchange a meager coin for
   a
   stale loaf of bread. The wealthy enter to exert influence and count
   profits. Dragonarmy soldiers enter to effect both order and chaos. The
   variety of beings that cross this room reflect a wide variety of
   Krynn's
   inhabitants and purposes.

   Phren Lane runs in a straight east-west line, cutting Delphon in the
   center as it takes it course. Far to the east, a set of the city gates
   can
   be seen, heavily guarded by the Green Dragonarmy. The desert wind sends
   particles of sand stinging painfully into the eyes. The brightly
   colored
   bazaar spreads out in a sea south, while the various species of cacti
   are
   kept in the gardens to the north.

   To
   the north, Phren Lane cuts through the center of Delphon. Beyond the
   road
   is the edges of the once famous cacti gardens. The smell of spicy food
   wafts in from the south, while shouts of merchants hawking their wares
   rings through the air.

   Walking Among The Tents
   The pathway through the bazaar splits off into four directions. Aromas
   of spicy grilled food lures citizens towards a restaurant to the west,
   while a large granite structure stands off to the east. South of here,
   a
   rather dingy tent stands at the edge of the bazaar. The colored tents
   brighten the drab city to the north.
   A brightly colored gecko runs along the streets in search of food.
