   Kanxi RIP*3

   POV:

   Log Rating: 5.0000

   Kanxi got mad at me for speaking the truth and killed me. I decided it
   was time for a little flag-tag. Kanxi happily obliged.

   The Tavern Square
   Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
   races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
   peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A
   dark
   alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
   executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street
   and
   the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp
   on
   the tavern wall.
   An experienced watchman stands here, guarding the captain.

   The captain is the huge

   This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
   banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from
   wooden
   stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
   sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going
   distort
   your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead
   away
   from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
   cobbled square.
