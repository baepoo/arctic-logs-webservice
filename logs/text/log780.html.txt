   A Shattered Gate
   The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
   steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
   These
   gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
   that
   it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
   before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
   enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
   rest
   on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
   solid.
   A bronze dragon with glistening scales awaits a rider.
   Helion Wreckor, Leading the Massacor is standing here.
