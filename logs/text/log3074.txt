   You utter the words, 'relocate'
   Under the Ramparts
   You are standing in the entrance to the keep, below the ramparts. North
   of you is a rusted portcullis surrounded by a thick chain. Looking to
   the
   east you spot a wooden ladder propped against the wall. The ladder
   leads
   upward to a metal-reinforced trapdoor in the ceiling. This most likely
   goes
   to the top ramparts. To the south you see a large outdoor courtyard
   filled
   with billowing clouds of dust. A tattered sign hangs loosely from a
   spike
   driven into the wall here.
   A small campfire fills the area with a warm, comfortable glow.
   <OXEN> Malcom, Not In The Middle is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
   . . . is circled by grisly chunks of flesh.
   <OXEN> Aimee, A Rise's Worst Nightmare is standing here. (flying)

   . . . has a metallic luster.
   <VA> Lord Elbryan Es'Shoik, Forrestal of Shoikan Grove is standing
   here. (aggressor) (flying) (
   invisible)
   You see the outline of a life form here, carrying: a lucky bone charm;
   a suit of ancient green
   and gold armor; a black leather belt with dangling bones; the sword of
   dragon's might.
   A fearsome blue dragon, Falkor, is standing here, ignoring you.
   Moola stumbles out of a puff of smoke.

   Outer Courtyard
   A restoration process has been started in this section of the outer
   courtyard. The granite walls show signs of reinforced rock being
   patched
   into them. The earth has been covered with flat stones which form a
   incomplete walkway going south. Light from the sky above glares
   brightly
   off the old ramparts above. An electric feel of excitement hovers in
   the
   air as the next move you make could bring you closer to a
   confrontation.
