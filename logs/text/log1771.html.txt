   Elendur RIP

   POV: Teca

   Log Rating: -1.0000

   We were bored and found this just waiting for us.

   You follow Phule east.
   A Road Through the Vingaard Mountains
   This well traveled road gently winds its way up the Vingaard Mountains,
   hugging the edges of the mountainsides. The area is fairly rocky, but
   there
   are some small patches of trees here and there, a bit of snow still
   hanging
   on their branches. A few hearty birds remain despite the cold, their
   song
   clear in the crisp air. The road gently slopes upward as it heads to
   the
   west, but takes a steep dip down to the base of the mountains to the
   east.
   Phule the Male Gnome is standing here. (flying)
   . . . has a granite appearance.
   <BSP> Elendur, Bloody Explorer of Doom is standing here. (flying)
   (invisible)
