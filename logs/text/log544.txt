Had no idea on Gilette lvl or class, just did what I had to do :)

The Chapel Garden
Young vallenwoods, oak and pine trees grow around you. Flowers of all
kinds can be found growing here. The smell in the air is very fragrant
and
this area sets your mind and body at ease. It is peaceful and you feel
totally safe here. There are a few wooden benches under one of the
larger
trees and a small pond with a few fish swimming around in the clear
waters.
The corpse of Islan is lying here.
Xecris the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here. (white aura)
Gilette the Male Human is RESTING here.
Syk NoMore, Furshai Reborn is RESTING here.
Oklea walks about the garden, tending the foliage. (white aura)
