   Road Through the Camp
   Winding its way through the jumbled and twisting tents, this road seems
   to be the proper path through all the chaos. Shouts from the merchants
   can
   be heard ringing out over the tops of the tents. Travellers pass by you
   on
   their way through the caravan. Some stop to buy the wares of the
   merchants,
   others pull their cloaks over their heads and walk along oblivious to
   the
   shouting.

   At the Center of the Camp
   You have reached the center of this camp and the throng of merchants
   has gotten almost unbearable. All of them shouting and yelling about
   the
   fabulous things they have to offer. The largest of the tents in the
   caravan
   lie to the east and west of you, and those seem to be the most well
   established places of doing business. To the south, the road continues
   to
   twist and turn through the tents and merchants.

   Dusty Road
   The merchants and tents have begun to thin out, leaving only a dusty
   road thick with wagon tracks and horse prints. The dusty road leads to
   the
   east, while the shouts of the merchants can still be heard echoing from
   the
   north. The offensive smell of dung drifts to your nose from the large
   tent
   to the west.

   Dusty Road
   The shouts of the merchants are now but a faint sound barely heard over
   the mighty winds of the Wastelands of Khur. The tents are still very
   visible to the north, and you can see a large covered wagon to the
   south.

   Before a Large Wagon
   The deep wagon tracks in the dirt road lead up to this huge wagon that
   rests off the road a bit. The dusty road continues to the north and
   south,
   while a small set of wooden steps leads to the door of the wagon. The
   peaks
   of the tents can still be made out a ways to the north west.
