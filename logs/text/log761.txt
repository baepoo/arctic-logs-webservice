Top of the Mountain
The summit of the mountain can barely be made out even at this
distance. The wind blows much harder near the top of the mountain and
the
biting cold makes it a very unpleasant place to be. There is no life
anywhere on the mountain and the only sound that can be heard is that
of
the wind smashing against the peaks of the mountain. The path seems to
lead
around the peak of the mountain but it's difficult to ascertain where
exactly one is in relation to the lower regions of the mountain.
Ocho, Fat Mino Sailor is resting here. (flying)

stood tall.
135H 37V 1X 1C Mem:27 Exits:NEW> eBefore The Ruined Gate
The city of Old Tarsis spreads out west of here, through the large
gates leading into the city. Further south, an arid desert wasteland
stretches off to the horizon, dotted with cacti, and dried shrubbery.
The
northern horizon is dominated by a towering mountain, rising
majestically
into the sky.

The dry expanse of the desert covers the horizon, spotted with
occasional patches of dried shrubbery and cacti. The rolling dunes seem
to
stretch out into forever, and it isn't likely that you would find any
refreshment in this sandy wasteland. The eastern gates of Old Tarsis
just
north of here, seem much more inviting.

The desert seems huge an unending, there is life no where to be found.
The air is still and stagnant while the heat is almost unbearable. One
expects a barren waste in a desert but this desert has nothing but sand
in
all directions.

To the south there appears to an oasis, which seems odd given the bleak
nature of the desert. Signs of life can be seen in this area, which is
in
stark contrast to the rest of the desert. The heat is not as
intolerable as
in other parts of the desert although it is hardly comfortable.
135H 30V 1X 1C Mem:27 Exits:NS> sThe Oasis
In the middle of this barren wasteland, you have stumbled across a
green and fertile patch of land. Animals of all sorts gather around the
oasis to drink and make merry. The desert is alive with the sound of
music,
which emanates from a small cluster of tents set up along the north
side of
the lake. Bubbles occasionally burst from the water, as if escaping
from
some underground area.
