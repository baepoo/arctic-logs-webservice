seem to envelope the path and cover it up, almost completely hiding it
from

A Cut Path
The grass suddenly seems to part, opening up to a large trail the leads
on through the plains. Examining the grass, it looks as though it has
purposely been cut down and hacked through, and kept at its short
length.
The path twists and curves through the dangerous plains and you can
almost
make out a thin trickle of smoke on the horizon. To the south, the
grasses
seem to envelope the path and cover it up, almost completely hiding it
from
prying eyes.
The corpse of Locki is lying here.
The corpse of Mahadeva is lying here.
A small harp lays here.
The corpse of Ebil the fearsome blue dragon is lying here.
The corpse of Mleth is lying here.
<Myth> Rehab the Male Gnome is standing here. (flying)
. . . has a metallic luster.
<Myth> Hanlon Phat Bottom, Making the world go round is standing here.
. . . has a tough exterior.
<Myth> Mormont the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here. (flying)
