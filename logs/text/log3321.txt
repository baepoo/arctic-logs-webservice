The Knights' High Road
Stretching out from horizon to horizon, the Knights' High Road passes
through the Solamnic Plain, connecting the city of Vingaard with the
lord
city of Palanthas. The shining jewel of Solamnia, Palanthas lies far to
the
west and north, beyond Westgate Pass in the Vingaard Mountains, while
the
city of Vingaard lies east-south-east of here. The tall grasses of the
plains seem to go on forever, gently swaying back and forth with the
breeze. Barely visible far to the west are a few mountain peaks.
