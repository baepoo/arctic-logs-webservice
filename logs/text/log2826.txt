Solace Square
Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly
A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.
A Solace peacekeeper is here making his rounds.
