   The Middle Valley
   You are about halfway down the sloping sides of the valley. Many
   strange and exotic beasts roar around you, and you almost trip as you
   step
   over the edge of a huge footprint. There are claw marks twenty or
   thirty
   feet up on some of the trees, and you're not at all certain you want to
   meet what created them.

   The Middle Valley
   You are about halfway down the sloping side of the huge, lost valley.
   All around you, the footsteps of the great scaly inhabitants of this
   place
   rumble in your ears, and you think you can hear the beating of drums
   coming
   from the valley floor below. Nearby, a bird-like mammal perched on a
   limb
   screeches at you.

   The Middle Valley
   The forested slopes of the valley rise above and below you. A strange,
   many colored bird calls at you from the branches of a nearby tree, as a
   spider the size of your fist drops from above. The lumbering footsteps
   of
   this valley's huge inhabitants cause the trees to shake as they walk
   past,
   and several of them seem to have fallen over, making progress
   difficult.
