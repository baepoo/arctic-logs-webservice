   Foyer of The Pilgrim
   Once the entrance hall to Keep DonRigh, the glory and artistic taste of
   its decorators are no longer visible. Tapestries hang from cold walls,
   the
   images they had originally portrayed now mere shadows on a black
   background. The furniture, covered with silk, now lies in wet piles in
   the
   damp corners. In the east wall a door has been tightly shut, a carved
   picture of a book upon its worn down surface. Also, to the west and
   north,
   doors possibly lead to other parts of the abandoned keep.

   Mages' Study
   An accomplished red-robed mage, Anatole was given the prestigious
   responsibility of teaching in Palanthas. He has started a school of his
   own
   for budding magicians, who will eventually complete their studies at
   the
   Tower at Wayreth.
   A magical sign floats in the air here...it glows blue..it glows dimly
   An orrery is mounted on a stand here...it glows blue
   Anatole the Amazing is here to teach you the ways of magic.
   A Palanthian guard stands here, watching warily for troublemakers.

   Hallway
   The somber quietness blankets the hallway, the memories of the past
   being mourned by nature. Stone faces in the rock peer out, their mouths
   pulled down into maddening frowns. Stepping through the fallen
   ornaments,
   the tapestries and the furniture, a small gust of wind moves quickly
   down
   the hall; the keep sighs in pain. To the north a strange change in
   color
   can be seen in the brick wall.
   A mercury golem, Janx, stands here, its body incessantly flowing.

   Hall of Festivals
   Extending the full length of the room, an oversized banquet table
   hunches close to the stone floor. Broken dishes, goblets, and utensils
   cover its scarred surface, the revelers having abandoned their meal in
   the
   ancient past. As in almost a dream, slender tendrils of steam pour in
   from
   the outside, this feast hall seems to come alive for a brief moment.
   The
   music of a bard filters sweetly throughout the din of a party. Then, as
   suddenly as these ghostly images arrived, the steam fades away and the
   chaotic mess before you appears again. Smiling to yourself, memories
   that
   do not belong to you flood, overwhelm.
   A mercury golem, Janx, stands here, its body incessantly flowing.

   the dirt floor. Twinkling like gems, broken bottles reflect the light,
   the

   be. Broken wine racks lay splintered against the stone wall, their
   contents
   shattered at your feet. Breathing in the musty air, coughing, you
   shuffle
   through the room. Against the east wall, you discover, a rack has
   survived

   of
   something evil.

   Wine Cellar
   Clear light spills in from above, the silver stream casting itself over
   the dirt floor. Twinkling like gems, broken bottles reflect the light,
   the
   thick layer of dust only serving to make the cellar eerier than it
   should
   be. Broken wine racks lay splintered against the stone wall, their
   contents
   shattered at your feet. Breathing in the musty air, coughing, you
   shuffle
   through the room. Against the east wall, you discover, a rack has
   survived
   all these years, the bottles of wine staring dully out at you. In your
   head, you begin to mistake the rushing of the wind for the whispering
   of
   something evil.

   The Ebullient Elephant Inn
   This spacious tavern is full of customers. This is obviously a favorite
   hangout of many of Palanthas's middle class citizens. There is a bar
   against one wall and a staircase leading upstairs to the room clerk's
   office. The only exit is back north to Sword Street.

   You are outside the city gates of Palanthas. There really isn't much of

   wall is very becoming of their beautiful city, they would rather show
