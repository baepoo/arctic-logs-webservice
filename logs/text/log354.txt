Academy Square
A thoroughly pleasant spot, this clearing is carpeted in ornamental
grasses, fragrant herbs, and perennials. A simple but elegant sundial
occupies a central position in the intersection. Running through the
greenery are stone footpaths leading to buildings north, east and west.
You sense a life form.
Fyre the Male High Elf is standing here.

Western Way
In what once was one of the worst areas of destruction, there is now a
wide, straight, clean street leading west out of the city. To the north
is
Academy Square, a center of learning.
An arrow pointing east floats nearby...it glows blue..it glows dimly
You sense a life form.

Western Way
In the Troubles, this area was one of the worst damaged. Now a wide,
clean, straight street runs east and west between the prosperous
looking
buildings on either side.

Western Way
In the Troubles, this area was one of the worst damaged. Now a wide,
clean street runs east-west. From the east the unmistakable sounds and
smells of commerce. The hurly-burly of the city fades out further to
the
west.

Western Way
The bustle of horsecarts, merchants and townspeople moving along this
wide street marks it as a main arterial to the business areas of
Tarsis.
The great fountain in the central square splashes noisly to the east,
while
from the north come the sounds of tradesmen hawking their wares.
An arrow pointing north floats nearby...it glows blue..it glows dimly
You sense a life form.

Market Square
A central paved area is surrounded by grass and trees. There are some
park benches here and there under the trees, giving an almost
picnic-area
feel to the place. Travelling salesmen sometimes set up their wagons
here,
to take advantage of traffic coming and going from the two major stores
off
the square, one to the north and one to the west.

North Main Street
North Main Street, once a muddy path, is now a brightly lighted, busy
thoroughfare. New Tarsis Square lies to the south, while markets and
other
new buildings cluster to the east and west.

North Main Street
Main Street bustles with activity as the citizens of New Tarsis get on
with their lives. Here and there a peddler offers his wares.
Occasionally,
one might catch a glimpse of a mage's robes as he passes unhindered
through
the crowds. The traffic seems heavier to the south.

Jaith comes out of hiding.
Jaith gives his knife a quick thrust and twist, as he strikes Napas in
the back with it.
