   To those who are about to die, we salute you.

   The Foyer
   This large room serves as the entryway to the citadel's second floor.
   The vaulted ceiling high above you is nearly invisible in the dark
   shadows.
   Sconces are attached to all four sides of the many pillars that rise
   into
   the air to support the ceiling and provide light that is adequate, but
   still relatively dim. The walls have no windows or openings for air to
   come
   in, resulting in the air being warm and stale. Two large doors to the
   east
   open out into the courtyard, while hallways lead to the north and
   south.
   A wall of force completely blocks off the west exit. [3]
