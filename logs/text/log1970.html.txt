   lThe King's Room
   You have entered the King of Sorinthalas's room. Present are many
   silken fineries and artistic works, sent to the king for his approval.
   Also
   present are many baskets of food and sweets. From what you are able to
   deduce, the king is either widowed or the children are inherited, as
   there
   are no female belongings in the room. Laid out on the bed are many
   silken
   robes and clothes. The bed itself is in fine shape, with bedposts and
   head
   rest made of carved oak. The only exit lies to the west.
   A stout elven guard stands here, protecting the King.
