   This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
   banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from
   wooden
   stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
   sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going
   distort
   your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead
   away
   from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
   cobbled square.
