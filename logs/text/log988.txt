Wakki Gets Recalled!

POV: Keila

Log Rating: 1.2500

Hunting Wakki for Item Thievery (No, I don't use Opt Unlegible)

Pregame Show: Wakki Stole Chasuble from Me. I've told him on several
occasions that i would kill him
If i saw him on. He chose to ignore my warning. Saw him Near Pal,
Assumed DKO, then Did the Job
Except Lame Darkmoons recalled him, so They died, or recalled.

Akroma pushes into the gates and nothing seems to happen. What a wuss!

begin

Inside the Gates
As you step through the gates you see the two plain towers which you
assume serve as guard towers, however you can't make out any openings
or
windows in the sides of them. A small courtyard opens up in front of
you,
ending at the side of the mountain, in which you can make out the
opening
leading on into darkness.
