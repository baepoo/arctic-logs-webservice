   The Halls of Myth
   Hanging from the center of a gold crown molded ceiling is a large
   chandelier burning a beautiful red flame. The flame is the result of
   the
   burning of sodium and some other select chemical compounds, secret to
   the
   pyromancers of Deep Mine. A servant seems to be dusting the ceiling and
   walls on a small step stool. This job must need to be done with some
   regularity, as the adventurers who frequent this stronghold track in
   copious amounts of debris.

   The Halls of Beast Clan
   The stench of sweat and grime hits you like a charging remorhaz as
   you enter the room. Not surprising, given how active your clan has been
   lately. It seems like they have single handedly rid Krynn of the last
   of
   the dragons and pulled down all the strongholds of the greatest lords
   and
   leaders. Yet somehow more pop up each day and your Clan fights on to
   bring order and domination to the world. The bright fireplace warms the
   room and provides the light for you to see your way to the bar and
   check
   in desk. Several waiters and waitresses bustle too and fro, bringing
   the
   much needed ale and sustenance to the worn out heroes. A bell hop
   stands
   by the check in desk, ready to stow your gear. The concierge stands by,
   ready to collect your Clan contribution before you head upstairs to
   your
   room and rest.
   You notice some bloody footprints on the ground.
