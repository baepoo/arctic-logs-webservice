   The blastwave rips Corbon in half and flings his torso far overhead.

   The preamble:
   -------------------
   Festi, recently Pk'ing on a fresh Druid, had Festi pzapped (+3/4 heals,
   +cons, other
   ok gear) for transferring gear from the recent Ruham kill. Seemingly,
   Corey/Festi
   does not take enough risks with his main characters.
   With such few forces, Nowclan was forced to re-equip him the Nowclan
   way - 4v9.
