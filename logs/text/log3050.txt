   A Frosty Path Through Twendle
   This grassy path, etched in deep, white frost, winds its way through
   several huts. Though populated, this village is strikingly quiet and
   the
   barbaric humans that pass you seem apprehensive. The huts are made of
   stone
   with thatched roofs and look rather crude, though stable. Skirting the
   foothills of the Khalkists north of here, many travelers pass through
   this
   village, though not all of them receive a warm welcome. The air is
   quiet
   and peaceful, filled with the distant giggle of laughing children,
   though
   their voices are soon hushed.
