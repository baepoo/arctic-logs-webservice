   The Tomb of King Redplain
   Born in the time of a great war with the Dragonarmies, King Redplain
   was taught to fight at a very young age. His name was given upon his
   birth
   in the plains when they were awashed with the blood of valiant
   warriors.
   Learning quickly the skills needed to fight, Redplain fought the
   dragonarmies and won. He gained the faith of the village and became the
   youngest king to the Que Kul. He died at a young age in a duel with a
   Solamnic Knight who had insulted his honor and his family.

   Dust has long since settled in thick layers on the floors and stones of
   this crypt. You walk through the crypt with a small tinge of fear in
   your
   footsteps. A low moan breaks the silence in the crypt and makes you
   shiver.

   the
   crypt gives you a feeling of safety, and a hope of escape.

   stirs at your feet as you step into the crypt. It takes a few moments
   for
   your eyes to adjust, and even longer for your lungs to adjust to all
   the
   dust they are taking in. Looking around you, this chamber is covered in
   cobwebs. Looks like noone ever comes in to clean the place. Tribal
   markings
   of the Que Kul are carved in various places all around the walls. To
   the
   east, a huge set of bronze doors leads back out into the burial grounds

   A Granite Structure
   Carved from the inner stones of the Khalkhist's, this granite structure
   stands tall and proud, boasting tall, bronze doors facing into the
   dawning
   sun. The Que Kul must have spent years building this structure, and as
   you
   stare into its brilliance your respect for the mighty warriors
   heightens.
   To the right of the bronze doors, a plaque made of gold shines with
   polished luster. To the west, the mounds of stones covers the dead
   warriors
   of the Que Kul tribe.
