Quinefier died for past crimes committed by KoS on the thief

The Northern Gate
This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these,

the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the
forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.
