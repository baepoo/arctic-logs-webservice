Log Rating: 1.7826

I was running around, peacefully minding my business, when this Tort
guy tries to hold me in the Pal magic shop. I stabbed him a couple
times, and he ran away. A little while later, Tort found a friend Wyand
& his gargoyle and they both came to attack helpless me! Well, one
dies, and the other runs away.
