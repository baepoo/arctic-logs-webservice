   Efficient spells!

   Welcome to the land of Krynn.

   Reception
   At the top of the stairs from the inn's lobby is a small room serving
   as a room registry. Belle sits behind a pine counter, quietly reading,
   until a customer arrives. Behind her is a long rack of wooden
   cubbyholes
   and hooks holding room keys. Long halls with many closed doors stretch
   to
   either side. It's quiet and well-kept here, conducive to a good night's
   sleep.
   A bulletin board with the heading 'Wanted' has been posted on the far
   wall.
   The fez atop this well muscled bouncer's head marks him a fierce
   adversary.
   Belle Hamson looks up from her book and beams at your approach.

   The Crossed Arms
   The low ceiling holds the smoke and noise close to the floor in this
   busy inn. A dozen long tables stand scattered about the room and a
   narrow
   stair in the back leads to the upper floor. Along the south wall, a
   fieldstone hearth holds a rotating spit. Several groups of adventurers
   are
   clustered about the various tables, each eying the others suspiciously
   and
   planning their campaigns in muted tones.
   A Tarsian peasant whistles happily on his way to work.

   Before a Humble Inn
   The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
   charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of
   the
   tunnel. This room is inteRESTINGly dim, and if not for the incredible
   brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous
   laughter
   and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to
   the
   Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out
   from
   heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
   wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
   Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the
   west
   lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.
   Rold Knold is standing here. (flying)
   . . . has a tough exterior.
