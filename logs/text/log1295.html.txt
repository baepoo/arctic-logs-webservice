   More Rocky Trail
   A steep trail leads up and down the mountain here. Far below you see
   what appears to be a forest and small town. Perhaps it is Solace. From

   long distance, you can not tell for sure.

   The Mountain Trail
   You are travelling along a rocky trail. This part of the trail is in
   fact an intersection. You see paths leading up, down, and east leaving
   from
   here. The paths up and down are quite steep and appear to be dangerous.

   The Top of the Trail
   You are at the top of the mountain trail. To the north, the mountain
   rises almost straight up. You know that it would be impossible to
   climb. A
   well kept path leads north from here and the trail itself leads down.

   Before the Dwarven Gates
   You stand before a huge pair of carved stone gates. They are set into
   the side of the mountain here. The path leads right up to the gates
   themselves. It also leaves south back down the mountain. It is apparent
   that the gates were built for a purpose. They appear quite sturdy and
   impregnable.
   The corpse of a dwarven gateguard is lying here. [2]
   A pile of steel coins.

   The Entryway
   You are in the entryway to the Dwarven Stronghold. The high domed
   ceiling was carved from the solid rock above you. Strong pillars rise
   all
   the way to the ceiling. The pillars line the great hall which goes
   north.
   Large gates are south of you. Small hallways lead east and west from
   here.
   Torches light the way.
