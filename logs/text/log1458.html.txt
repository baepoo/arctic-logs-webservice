   Topo flies in from the east.
   Beyond the City of Kalaman
   Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two
   paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off
   to
   the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
   fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
   grasses
   rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there
   is
   a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.
   Topo, Harbinger of Fate is standing here. (flying)
   Aca D'siac, Camel in the Blood Sea of Love is standing here. (flying)
   Icki Bonbon, Eternal Flame Bash is standing here. (flying)
   Iso the Male High Elf is standing here. (flying)
