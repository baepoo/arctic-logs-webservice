Nearing the City of Vingaard
The road here passes through some large fields of grain, a sign that a
large city is nearby. Looking westward, the towers of Vingaard Keep are
visible perched atop a hill with the city's walls nearby. The road
continues north to a junction of roads from other parts of the
continent
and a small tollhouse that stands watch over the intersection. To the
south, the road crosses the Vingaard River via a ford in the river.

The Tollhouse
This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
A shield is lying on the ground.
A woodsman's axe lies on the ground.
A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.

A Small Sleeping Quarter
This bedroom is designed to house the tax collector stationed at the
tollhouse. It is fairly small, with only the very essentials. A
featherbed
is up against the north wall, and a small table sits opposite against
the
south wall below a window. A woven rug sits in the center of the room
atop
the cold gray stones. There are a few sconces for candles, but provide
only
dim light for the room.
