   Hoss won't always be there to save you

   POV: Abom

   Log Rating: 1.9630

   Found Remington renting in an unaccessable inn by 99.99 % of arctic
   population, it was norelo but you could teleport to him. elsa thought
   the inn would be peace, died. 2 heros come storming in but alas,
   remington is saved by immortal means.

   Eker flies down.
   You follow Eker down.
   The Halls of God Clan
   The stench of sweat and grime hits you like a charging remorhaz as you
   enter the room. Not surprising, given how active your clan has been
   lately.
   It seems like they have single handedly rid Krynn of the last of the
   dragons and pulled down all the strongholds of the greatest lords and
   leaders. Yet somehow more pop up each day and your Clan fights on to
   bring
   order and domination to the world. The bright fireplace warms the room
   and
   provides the light for you to see your way to the bar and check in
   desk.
   Several waiters and waitresses bustle too and fro, bringing the much
   needed
   ale and sustenance to the worn out heroes. A bell hop stands by the
   check
   in desk, ready to stow your gear. The concierge stands by, ready to
   collect
   your Clan contribution before you head upstairs to your room and rest.
