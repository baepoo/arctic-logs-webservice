   Old Road in the Forest
   The well maintained Old Road continues its path to the north and south.
   The forests to the west are made up of thousands of tall oaks, their
   branches spreading outwards in a glorious canopy. This forest is the
   boundary of the Qualinesti elves, their capitol Qualinost somewhere in
   the
   northern parts. The road south leads eventually to the Kharolis
   Mountains
   and on south to Tarsis.
   Taikoubou the Male Human is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
   . . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.
