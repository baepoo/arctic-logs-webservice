   Clerk's Office
   Here you can rent a room for the evening or however long you intend to
   stay. The clerk assures you that the sheets are clean and the towels
   are as
   soft as a noble's behind.
   A pile of worn maps sits in the corner, free to adventurers.
   A bulletin board with the heading 'Wanted' has been posted on the far
   wall.
   Smoking a fat cigar, a low ranking guard vigilantly watches the inn.
   A tired looking clerk sits here waiting for you to say something
   intelligent.

   280H 114V 11544294X 900C Mem:5 Exits:D> dThe Ebullient Elephant Inn
   This spacious tavern is full of customers. This is obviously a favorite
   hangout of many of Palanthas's middle class citizens. There is a bar
   against one wall and a staircase leading upstairs to the room clerk's
   office. The only exit is back north to Sword Street.
   Floyd, the barkeep, idly whistles a merry tune while polishing the bar.
   280H 113V 11544294X 900C Mem:5 Exits:NU> nSword Street
   This block of Sword Street is in the southwestern part of the city. A
   sign hangs in front of one of the buildings to the south. Sword Street
   continues to the east and west.

   Secret Path
   The undergrowth of the forest floor has overgrown this dirt path,
   hordes of weed and grass advancing ruthlessly like an army of
   barbarians.
   The trees, branches covered with the perfumed blooms of the new growth
   season, rustle slightly, and the winds whistle their mournful, melodic
   ditty. The entire forest seems to come alive with a sudden, and free,
   flow
   of energy, shifting in the wind, moving across the ground with clawed
   roots, breathing deeply in the cool air. The tinkling of music, the
   voices
   of the faerie folk, plays its games, hiding behind the trees and
   darting
   into sullen shadows. All is alive, as if the ground you now traverse
   upon
   is a sleeping beast of mammoth proportions. The trail leads to the west
   branching off several times in the distance. In the gloom of the
   foliage,
   barely visible, tiny shacks can be seen.
   <MAEL> Reverie the Female Hill Dwarf is standing here. (flying)
   bash Reverie. . . is surrounded by a shimmering light.
   A small pigmy-like creature stands here.
