   Stephen RIP

   POV: Fyodor

   Log Rating: 2.4000

   I have no clue who this guy is but he talked mad shit to me and my
   brother for no real apparent reason. Notice end when he could recall
   but chooses to run his trap again and dies. Super duper MVP to
   Revenant, apparently even the dead cant stand this guy
