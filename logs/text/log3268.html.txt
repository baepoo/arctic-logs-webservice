   dizzy and confused, wondering how you ever got here, and how you could
   possibly leave. You feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand on
   end,
   and suddenly you feel as though someone, or something, is watching you,
   waiting...
   Blood flows eternally from a fountain here in the emptiness of the
   Abyss.
