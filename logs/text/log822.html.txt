   The Reception
   This is the reception of the lodge, where you would sign in for a
   room. This is also a very popular place where adventurers sit around
   and
   share tales of their journeys. Some stairs in the back lead up to the
   quarters.
   A wooden bulletin board with the heading 'Wanted' is posted on the
   wall.
   The manager of Traveler's Lodge stands here ready to sign you in.
   A tall and strong bouncer, hired to protect the lodge's customers,
