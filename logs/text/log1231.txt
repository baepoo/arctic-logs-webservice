   lookInside the Cloudmaster
   You are forced to stay inside the Cloudmaster as you pass through the
   deepest parts of space. The threat of being sucked off the deck is just
   too
   great. Here on the inside there are many marvels to behold. An oaken
   table
   with brass legs is nailed to the floor, like most items here are. A
   large
   machine takes up most of the room, many knobs, pullies, levers, and
   handles
   jut from the innards of the beast. You couldn't possibly imagine what
   it
   could do. A small hatch leads up onto the deck.
   Glok the Female Hill Dwarf is standing here. (flying) (red aura)
   . . . is outlined with a dim aura.
   Tannan Brightshield, Page to Lady Clem is resting here. (flying)
   Uno is standing here. (flying)
   . . . has a tough exterior.
   Wingover, the Navigator of the Lunitari Exploration Crew, is standing
   here.

   open hatchYou are sucked out into space, lost forever.
   In the Clutches of Space
   As some unknowing person opens the hatch of the Cloudmaster, all that
   was inside the hull is mercilessly sucked out into space. Lost forever
   to
   play amongst the sun beams and meteors.

   Welcome to the land of Krynn.
   The Reception
   The reception contains a small desk. A long hall leads behind the desk
   here and you can tell this is where adventurers rest and take time off
   from
   their journeys. A small stairway goes down towards what appears to be a
   lively tavern.
   A glass vial filled with a dark liquid has been left here.
   A long black piece of walnut lies on the ground.
   A large board with numerous wanted posters tacked on it is here.
   A red-haired young lady is wiping down a table here.
   A receptionist sits here doing her nails.
   A man wearing heavy armor is standing here.
