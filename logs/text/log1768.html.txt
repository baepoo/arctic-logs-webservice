   Fer RIP.

   POV: Hyarik

   Log Rating: 1.2500

   After playing two days, Tsalon got slayed by randomers. Teamed up with
   old friends to kill him.

   Fer and Ikey had been harassing newbies for a while.
   Tsalon offered his assistance in terms of flags, after only playing
   arctic for two days.
   Ikey died prior to this, but was utter trash. This was fun however.
