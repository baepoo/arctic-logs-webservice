Huan dies

POV: Tara

Log Rating: 2.0666

Poor Huan.

170H 25V 1802652X 345C Exits:NS>
Huan focuses harshly on you and utters the words, 'silence'.
170H 25V 1802652X 345C Exits:NS> st
You stand up.
170H 25V 1802652X 345C Exits:NS> c 'l b' huan
There is lightning in the sky.
170H 25V 1802652X 345C Exits:NS> You utter the words, 'lightning bolt'
The lightning bolt hits Huan with full impact.

b' huan
Huan focuses harshly on you and utters the words, 'silence'.
You suddenly lose all feeling of your mouth and tongue.
170H 25V 1802652X 345C [Tara:Perfect] [Huan:V.Bad] Mem:3 Exits:NS>
You miss Huan with your bludgeon.
170H 25V 1802652X 345C [Tara:Perfect] [Huan:V.Bad] Mem:3 Exits:NS> You
try your hardest to form the magic words.
Your lips move, but no sound emerges.
170H 25V 1802652X 345C [Tara:Perfect] [Huan:V.Bad] Mem:3 Exits:NS>
Huan panics, and attempts to flee.
Huan flies north.

The Virkhus Hills
These rolling hills lie just west of the Solamnic Plain, separating the
lowlands from the vast altitudes of the Vingaard Mountains farther
west.
The road winds its way between the hills, gently rising and falling. To
the
sides of the roads lie expansive grasslands, gently swaying in the
breeze.
The air is clean and refreshing. The road extends westward through the
Virkhus hills, and south into the Solamnic Plains.
Huan the Male Human is standing here. (flying)
170H 23V 1802652X 345C Mem:3 Exits:SW> ki huan
Huan focuses harshly on you and utters some strange words.
Huan channels the powers of earth and you are blasted with dirt.
154H 23V 1802652X 345C [Tara:V.Good] [Huan:V.Bad] Mem:3 Exits:SW> You
do the best you can!
154H 23V 1802652X 345C [Tara:V.Good] [Huan:V.Bad] Mem:3 Exits:SW>
Huan misses you with his slash.
You bludgeon Huan extremely hard.
The power of the elements is channeled through your staff!
A ball of earth shoots out from your staff and smashes Huan to pulp!
You receive 0 experience.
Huan is dead! R.I.P.
The death cry of Huan echoes from somewhere nearby...
