This building smells awful. Probably from all the noxious fumes from

stink.

In a Dark Tunnel
The room is so thickly draped in darkness you can only assume that it
is
magically induced. Even by torchlight you can scarcely make out the
outline
of your hand in front of you, even less so the walls of the tunnel. You
can
feel the slope of the floor gently even out as you travel here. A light
breeze from the east gently brushes your cheek, refreshing you.

In a Dark Tunnel
After being in these tunnels in the darkness, you begin to understand
what it is to be blind. You thank your gods that you are, or at least
were,
blessed with the gift of sight and feel a brief twinge of sympathy for
those
less fortunate. You feel a gradually increasing slope to the tunnels
here.
You cannot remember how long you have been in the tunnels, all you know
is
that you want out.

On a Mountain Path
The dirt path has four ruts instead of two. Puzzled, you examine them
and then realize as the first ruts formed, rather than force their
horses
or mules through the mud, drivers moved over a few feet, producing a
new
set of ruts inbetween and beside the old ones. A large hill looms to
the
south and the road arcs around a large cliff that runs off the hill to
the
south and curves northward and westward.
