The Multitude of Choices
You ascend the vortex, expecting death. However, right as you feel the
life will be ripped from your physical body, the skull below you
flashes,
and suddenly everything changes. You are standing at a four way
junction of
strange passages. Everything here seems to be pulsing with energy. You
feel
as though everything you thought you knew is wrong, and the universe
you
lived in was simply a poor copy of this, the universe of dreams. From
here,
you can choose either the north, south, east or west.
The corpse of Voldarin is lying here.

The Lab-a-Library
You are surrounded by what appears to be a combination of a
laboraratory and a library. The northern wall contains a small wooden
door,
but the remainder of the wall is covered with shelves of books. All the
books appear to be in good condition, despite some appearing to be
quite
old. The rest of the room is filled with cluttered tables. Some of the
tables are covered with notepads, while others are filled with beakers
containing liquids of varying colors.

Outside the Backdoor
This opening is quite peaceful. Other than the continual chirping of a
flock of sparrows and the creaking of the screen door directly to your
south, there are no other sounds. A small water pump is almost hidden
under
a young vallenwood tree. A short distance behind the tree you can see a
small gate.
