East Gate of New Tarsis
    Here at the east end of New Tarsis, a sturdy gate stands ready to seal
the city from any threat. The finest oak, imported from the northern
forests, swings on stout iron hinges. A heavy iron bar can be slotted into
notches in the walls themselves to prevent the gate's being opened. Stone
walls stretch to the north and south.
A Tarsian guard stands here, turning away undesirables from the city.
