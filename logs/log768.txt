The Clerics Guild
Young clerics and priests once travelled long distances to come here to
study and worship. An elaborate altar was once the centerpiece of this
chamber, but now it is gone and no one has visited or worshipped here
in
ages. The marble floor is cracked and uneven in several places, but
still
this room has a feeling of divinity and importance.

Within the Broken Temple
This large, now-empty chamber once served as the entryway into the
Tarsis temple. The floor, once a polished, shiny marble, is dull and
cracked, having lost it's sheen long ago. There is a chamber to the
north
that served as the clerics guild, and the exit to the temple lies to
the
east.

The broken road continues westward, towards the Tarsis Wastelands which
was once known for the vagrants and criminals that occupied the area.
Now
it, like the rest of the city, is barren and desolate. A road branches
off
to the south, leading towards the cities inn, while the main road leads
eastward, towards the city square.

The Tarsis Dump
A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
wind is
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
what
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

A Path Through the Park
This dry, dusty pathy leads north-south through the old Tarsis park.
This park was once full of life, a lush, vibrant forest rich with color
and
sound, but now it is a desolate, lonely place. The entire west half of
the
park has been replaced with a giant crater.

North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These

broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends

Before the Library
Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
Great
Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
from
its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
time
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
invaders is
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

The Back Alley
Even though the walls of the city are crumbling and large portions of
it are missing, this back-alley is still cast in shadows. Various thugs
once frequented this place, preying on hapless library-goers that had
lost
their way. The library itself rests to the south, a shattered, pathetic

Lost Knowledge
Once, great scholars came to this library to scour over tomes

The
countless shelves that were once lined with books are nowhere to be

The Tarsis Dump
A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
wind is
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
what
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.

criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands

torn

hollowed
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
have

The Tarsis Wastelands
The faint smell of decaying trash wafts in from the west on an unfelt

An Old Gypsy Wagon
This small wagon was once cluttered with strange artifacts and books,
but now it is a hollow, empty shell. Large sections of the roof are
missing, and there is a gaping hole in the northern wall. A wooden

Old Tarsis Square
Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken
shell
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are
shattered

others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the

The Ruined Market
Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
area
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.

Before the Bank
The broken road leading to the cities bank crunches and cracks beneath

city to
ruin, then withstanding the gradual decay of time has left this road in
a

your
feet and the floor is cracked and broken in several places, leaving the
floor very uneven and difficult to traverse.

that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted

The Tarsis Dump
A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
wind is
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
what
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.

Once, these Wastelands served as a walking ground for muggers,

shattered
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the

gates
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has
broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends
in a
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once
stood tall.

The Ruined Market
Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
area
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.

Wall Road
Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
bringing
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
is
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the

its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
time
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
invaders is
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

Before the Library
Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
Great
Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
from
its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
time
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
invaders is
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

Before the Library
Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
Great
Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
from
its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
time
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
invaders is
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

Lost Knowledge
Once, great scholars came to this library to scour over tomes
containing knowledge of the arcane arts, history, science, mathematics
and
countless other subjects. Now all of that is lost. Whatever was not
crushed, burned or otherwise destroyed has long since turned to dust.
The
countless shelves that were once lined with books are nowhere to be
seen
amidst the rubble.

North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis

others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the

The Tarsis Wastelands
Once, these Wastelands served as a walking ground for muggers,
prostitutes, thieves and the like, but now it is dead and barren. The
remains of a large ship that was grounded here can be seen to the
south,
but it had collapsed onto itself a long time ago, destroying whatever
might
have been in it.

Near the Tarsis Wastelands
The broken road continues westward, towards the Tarsis Wastelands which
was once known for the vagrants and criminals that occupied the area.
Now
it, like the rest of the city, is barren and desolate. A road branches
off
to the south, leading towards the cities inn, while the main road leads

still

A Path Through the Park
This dry, dusty pathy leads north-south through the old Tarsis park.
This park was once full of life, a lush, vibrant forest rich with color
and
sound, but now it is a desolate, lonely place. The entire west half of
the
park has been replaced with a giant crater.

Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis

others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the

The Tarsis Dump
A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
wind is
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
what
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.
A decaying vine rests on the ground.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These
gates

broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends
in a
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once

indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
area
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.

Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken

North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

Before the Library
Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
Great
Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
from
its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
time
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
invaders is
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.
