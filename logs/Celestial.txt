Caliburn's Shrine
     It doesn't take long for you to realize that this place carries with
it a holiness you've never felt before. The ivory colored walls are lined
with a collection of tapestries that depict the history of the temple,
before and after the Gargoyle and Aurinite war began. On the floor are two
long carpets, one red, one magenta, leading up to two thrones. On an
enormous tapestry on the wall between the two thrones is a sword, which you
know can only be Caliburn, the sword of sacred fires.
