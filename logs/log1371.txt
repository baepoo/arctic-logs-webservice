A Cramped Stone Chamber
This tiny chamber is much smaller and much less wide than the hallway
that can be seen through the opening to the south. Even for one person
it's
rather cramped: The ceiling is low, and abnormally tall humans would
have
to duck. Near the north end of the chamber, which isn't more than a few
feet away, a dark, dangerous-looking portal has been erected. The
proximity
of the surrounding smooth stone walls makes you feel a tad
claustrophobic.
Aiwa is standing here. (flying)
Ephesus the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here. (flying)
Lieriel the Male Theiwar Dwarf is standing here. (flying)
Kine the Male Hylar Dwarf is standing here. (flying)
Aryximaraki, Defender of the Minotaur Isle is standing here. (flying)
. . . has a tough exterior.

Aiwa stops following you.
440H 146V 6286684X 1C Mem:3 Exits:S> enter portal
Shielding your eyes from the the bright light emanating from the
portal,
you step towards the portal and enter it.
Within The Solid Stone Wall
Dizzied by the transportation, you emerge from the portal, and open
your eyes to see total blackness. You start to move your arm to feel
around
for something to produce light, when you realize you can't move your
arm.
Or anything else. The cold feeling of stone touches your bare skin, and
you
slowly come to realize that you are entirely encased within the solid
stone
wall. You try to open your mouth to scream for help, but even your jaw
is
locked into place. Your sad attempt at a cry of terror is muffled by
the
surrounding rock face. Without any oxygen, you suffocate minutes later.
The corpse of Aiwa is lying here.
The corpse of Lieriel is lying here.
The corpse of Kine is lying here.
