Za R.I.P.

Log Rating: -3.0000

Za dies.

Target: Za

You follow Machi east.
Death Row
Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark
and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are
boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is
nicknamed
'Death Row'.
