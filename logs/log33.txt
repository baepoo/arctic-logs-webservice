In a Dense Tropical Jungle
The foliage in this area is of considerable density, and the treetops

chirping merrily as they wing from tree to tree, but you are unable to
find
visual proof of their presence.

Aphitisis focuses harshly on you and utters some strange words.
You feel your life torn away as someone grabs you.
Twinkling lights surround you and cover your body entirely.
When they disappear, you find yourself somewhere else.
Lie still, you are dead.
You wish your wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!
