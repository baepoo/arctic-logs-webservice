Maxe supposed he was evil.

Feel the Powah!

A tiny faerie flies in from the south.
Maxe flies in from the south.
The Tollhouse
This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to
Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.
Maxe the Male Minotaur is standing here. (flying)
A tiny, shimmering faerie hovers near you.
