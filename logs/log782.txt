out
of the waters.

Old Tarsis Square
Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken
shell
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are
shattered
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the
city.
