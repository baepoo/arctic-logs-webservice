As you answer the riddle, you suddenly begin to feel
light headed. You try
to fight it, but soon the darkness overcomes you. The last thing you
feel is
a falling sensation.
You crash to the ground in a heap. Pain races through your body as you
try to
see how far you fell. Somewhat to your surprise, and dismay, you see
you have
not fallen into an endless pit, but only toppled over after answering
the
riddle.
It is pitch black.

A Dark Tunnel
The tunnel ends here in a fork, with a strange dark wall drenched in
shadows directly to your north. Off to the east and west are the mages
barracks, and back south is the tunnel away from here, and somehow the
prospect of going back that way has entered your head and you can think
of
nothing else you'd rather do than get away.

The spirit of Thanas, the Dark Bard arrives from the south.

Diogo flies in from the south.
The Nightlord's Chamber
A dark cloud engulfs this room, obscuring much of the Nightlord's
chamber
from your view. The magical cloud seems to blur anything you could
otherwise
discern clearly. Still, you barely see a bed in the far corner of the
room,
opposite of a desk. Upon the desk, you can make out a few objects which
you
guess to be scrolls and books. The floor is made of a smooth stone,
making
movement fairly easy. A strange scent of dust and decay fill your
nostrils,
making your head spin. An exit appears to be towards the south wall.
