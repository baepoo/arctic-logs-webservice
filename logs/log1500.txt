On a Cool Road
A flat, wavy sea of grass expands around you. Wildflowers break the
verdant monotony of the vegetation underfoot occasionally, and several
wild
fruit trees and roses also dot this path of mulch. A cool breeze blows
in
from the northeast. The Khurman Sea, also known as the Bay of Balifor,
is
not far from here. In the distance to the south, beyond several
foothills,
you can barely make out the towering peaks of the Khalkhist Mountains.

A Road in the Hills
This rough road winds its way through foothills near the Khalkist
Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east
and
northeast. These hills are green, dotted by the occasional dark grey
boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no
wagon
ruts on this rugged road.

The lands of Ak-Tubal and Kalin Ak-Phan stretch out to the east. They
are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during
the
Summer Solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see
several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east
beyond
the huge plains you can barely make out the glittering waves of the
Khurman
Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can
see
the jagged, towering peaks of the mighty Khalkist Mountains.

Southern Khalkist Mountains
The southern Khalkist Mountains are rugged, treacherous, and grim. Dark
gray, almost black, the mountains encroach around you. This small,
rocky
trail stays mostly on the lower parts of the mountain sides, as much
higher
would likely prove fatal because of the long falls into jagged rocks.
South
of here you can barely make out some foothills, while to the north more
jagged, craggy peaks await you.

Khalkhist Mountains which seem to spring up all around them. North of
here
the road, now barely visible due to frequent rock slides, ascends
sharply,
plunging into the mountain range. Looking to the southwest, rocky
foothills
and, eventually, gently rolling foothills timidly skirt this great
mountain
range. Very few animals are in sight, save for the wayward goat or
lion.

up

rising into the air. Brilliant crimson dust spews into the air as a
distant
volcano erupts. The ground shakes lightly, thought it must be quite
stronger closer to the volcano. The road is barely visible now, as
sheer
walls of rock flanking the bottoms of mountains are all about you.
