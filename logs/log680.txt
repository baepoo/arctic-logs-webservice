Oedipus RIP

POV: Scelesta

Log Rating: -2.4000

Oedipus rips on the road.

A Highway Through the Plains
Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and
weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire.
Oedipus, Mythical Mother Lover is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
. . . has a metallic luster.
A large guard stands here, keeping a constant eye out for trouble.
A large guard stands here, keeping a constant eye out for trouble.
An old man stands here, offering you a look at his wares.
