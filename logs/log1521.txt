Unknown NOWclan barbarian helps kill Oiuja.

Verata flies in from the north.
Skirting the Hills of Khuri-Khan
This road, perched high on the hillsides of the Khuri-Khan, roughly
follows the coastline of the Khurman Sea. The glittering blue waters
lay
east of here, and you can almost smell the sea air from this distance.
The
hills only get larger to the west, and are covered with green grass.
The
grass looks slightly parched, however, as it is very short and has
several
dry, yellow patchs. The road gets better to the north, both more
visible
and wider. To the south of here the road gradually descends into
flatlands
and, eventually, the Khalkhist Mountains.
Verata the Male Half Elf is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
. . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.
The vulture-like Demon Vrock stands here, flapping its large wings.

A cool breeze blows in from the east where you can see the Khurman Sea
a ways off. The road becomes much larger here and to the north while to
the
southeast it almost becomes buried in tall grasses. To the northwest
you
can see the hills of Khuri Khan. The road skirts the sides of these
rolling
hills which eventually merge with the lower, warmer hills of the
Ek-Khan.

On a Cool Road
Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanses of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east
towards
the Khurman Sea and south towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to
be
a favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred
circles
near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection
from
the elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of
the
waves of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.
A large tree of ripe apples grows here.
An old bent key is lying here...it glows blue
A wooden signpost has been hammered into the ground here.

On a Cool Road
A flat, wavy sea of grass expands around you. Wildflowers break the
verdant monotony of the vegetation underfoot occasionally, and several
wild
fruit trees and roses also dot this path of mulch. A cool breeze blows
in
from the northeast. The Khurman Sea, also known as the Bay of Balifor,
is
not far from here. In the distance to the south, beyond several
foothills,
you can barely make out the towering peaks of the Khalkhist Mountains.

A Road in the Hills
This rough road winds its way through foothills near the Khalkist
Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east
and
northeast. These hills are green, dotted by the occasional dark grey
boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no
wagon
ruts on this rugged road.
