Old Road in the Plains
The plains continue to stretch out to the north and to the east. A
small
camp of nomadic tents can be made out due east of here, while the
fabled
forests of the Qualinesti capital lay to the west. From the north,
there is
a light breeze, bringing with it the smell of salt. Far to the south,
the
rising foothills of the Kharolis Mountains begin to rise out of the
plains,
as the Old Road continues its course.
The corpse of a horse is lying here.
The corpse of a cheerful kender is lying here.
Nimblefeet the Male Kender is standing here. (flying)

Old Road in the Plains
The crest to the east winds down into the grassy plains as the road
meanders to the south. Westward, the trees of a large forest outline
the
crests of a distant mountain range. To the southeast, a small set of
tents
can be made out of some nomad tribe. Scattered farms are quite visible
in
this region, the crops swaying lightly in the wind.
Nimblefeet the Male Kender is standing here. (flying)
A young, strong looking horse stands here beating his hooves softly.
A magnificent percheron is standing here.
