Upon normal zoning we spot a few WRs logged on fast, and soon reports
tell they in Palanthas inn. Zone group prepares to fight in Tarsis,
hasting self, and then recalls to Palanthas to join rest.
Merken/Rodnic/Cyril log on at that moment simultaneously. Too bad WR
leave the place and run to GP.

We go after, nothing happens, walk back..in a few ticks they log more
people, and leave the inn heading Palanthas, and we walk to meet them
in halfway.

One additional note (policy or so), dont use newbies in pk related
stuff, it isn't cool nor legal (at most spy with them). That is, no
looting, holding, staying in hope of getting aread.
