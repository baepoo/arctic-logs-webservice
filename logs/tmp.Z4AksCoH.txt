In short:

Veron had been soloing in Daltigoth, and while resting met something
expectable. We gathered group semi-fast (took some 5 ticks...if you
die try to act fast, don't start analyzing/whining/fuming right then,
just inform all and get group set), and after Figna's clairs run to
get the target.

Millen was surprisingly careless, resting some 30 rooms from Veron's
death place, chatting with us while we were running tither.

Gains where rather decent, 100k, +100 health armour and NV item
mainly.
