The Dusty Arena
When you enter the Arena, you are amazed to see that it is merely a
long, dusty hallway, with doors lining each side. It seems very long,
but
because the ceiling is open to the sky, the sun beats down and makes
things
hazy, as though you were in the desert. The walls of the hallway are
smooth
marble, and the floor is made of sun-dried mud, stained with dark blood
in
many places. From the many doorways, you hear sounds of battle, and
from
time to time you hear a long, agonized death-cry.
A dark, shimmering portal stands before you beckoning you to enter.
The image of a phantasmal abomination flickers in and out of view.
404H 186V 1X 8.19% 2055C Mem:1 Exits:(NE)S(W)>
You utter the words, 'relocate'
A Cramped Nook
This is a small cramped space, with black marble walls rising up from
all directions, leaving little space for a person, let alone a party of
adventurers. There seems to be no exit, until your foot slips and you
almost fall into a large hole in the ground. Peering down, you attempt
to
make out any sign of life, but it is simply too dark.
A dark, shimmering portal stands before you beckoning you to enter.
