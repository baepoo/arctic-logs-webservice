Northern Avenue
You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to
form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and
hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at
the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly
Chupubucabra, Flair of Fury is standing here.

A Small Side Street
You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the
clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the
tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue
to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching
the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the
stairway.

Solace Square
Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
huge
vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some
sorts.
A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
the
thick limbs which house the guild hall.
A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly
A stray dog slowly moves about the area, sniffing the nearby trees.
A percheron is tethered here.
