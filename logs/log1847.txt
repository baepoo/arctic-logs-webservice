Kee bites the dust

POV: Gurr

Log Rating: -0.5833

Death #1) Kee walks into cloudkill, gets poisoned, dies. (never asked
for a remove potion either!) Death #2) Kee suicides himself to pigmies.
Death #3) First actual death! Hoorah.

Kee twists around to see you place a thin black sword in his back.

You massacre Kee with your pierce.
You miss Kee with your pierce.
Kee misses you with his whip.

It is pitch black.
421H 14V 3467824X 0C Exits:SW> It is pitch black.
Her dragonfly wings flapping lightly, a beautiful woman is here.
Kee the Male Gnome is resting here. (flying)
421H 12V 3467824X 0C Exits:NS> You stealthily dip the hood in a toxic
concoction of your own making.
421H 12V 3467824X 0C Exits:NS> Kee reaches behind himself quickly, only
to discover your deadly sword
in his back.
You receive 0 experience.
Kee is dead! R.I.P.
421H 12V 3467824X 0C [Kee:Dying] Exits:NS>
The death cry of Kee echoes from somewhere nearby...
Ehux stops following Kee.
A sylph stops following Kee.
A sylph transcends this world and enters another plane.

A shadow suddenly falls over you. You look at the sky, and see Takhisis
reaching for you. You scream in terror, and suddenly black out.
Welcome to the Abyss.
