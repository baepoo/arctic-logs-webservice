A Very Strange Room
The first thing you notice about this room is that there is a large
gaping hole in the floor! Centered in the room and occupying most of it
is
a nearly perfectly round shaft. Aside from the three-foot border along
the
edge, the deep, dark shaft is all that is here. Iron sconces are
affixed on
either side of the wall, empty, shedding no light on anything. A draft
blows up from the bottom of the shaft, flowing into the room.

medallion; a glowing scroll of recall.

Lord's Hall
Long ago, before the Rose Rebellion, this impressive room was known as
the Throne Room. Following the founding of the Solamnic Knighthood, the
room came to serve a different purpose, and has since been known as
Lord's
Hall. On the west side, stone arches surround beautiful casement
windows.
Large mirrors hang from the eastern wall opposite the windows, light
glittering off their silvered surface and gold leafed frames. A few
torches
on the wall cast light that shimmers and dances about as it burns. High
above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the
shining
colors and images of the knighthood faded and dull. On the south end,
the
red-carpeted floor takes a few steps up. Rather than a single throne,
four
elegantly carved chairs rest here behind a bench.

Before the Throne Room
The hallway comes to and end here at a massive, beautifully detailed
set of oak doors. The doors, while still quite nice, must have been
spectacular in the past. The gold highlights of the carvings of knights
in
battle and the images of the Knighthood have been worn, or possibly
scraped
away. Stone walls border you to the south and east, rising high up to
the
vaulted ceiling. The rest of the hallway extends north past the
turrets.

Lord's Hall
Long ago, before the Rose Rebellion, this impressive room was known as
the Throne Room. Following the founding of the Solamnic Knighthood, the
room came to serve a different purpose, and has since been known as
Lord's
Hall. On the west side, stone arches surround beautiful casement
windows.
Large mirrors hang from the eastern wall opposite the windows, light
glittering off their silvered surface and gold leafed frames. A few
torches
on the wall cast light that shimmers and dances about as it burns. High
above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the
shining
colors and images of the knighthood faded and dull. On the south end,
the
red-carpeted floor takes a few steps up. Rather than a single throne,
four
elegantly carved chairs rest here behind a bench.

Lord's Hall
Long ago, before the Rose Rebellion, this impressive room was known as
the Throne Room. Following the founding of the Solamnic Knighthood, the
room came to serve a different purpose, and has since been known as
Lord's
Hall. On the west side, stone arches surround beautiful casement
windows.
Large mirrors hang from the eastern wall opposite the windows, light
glittering off their silvered surface and gold leafed frames. A few
torches
on the wall cast light that shimmers and dances about as it burns. High
above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the
shining
colors and images of the knighthood faded and dull. On the south end,
the
red-carpeted floor takes a few steps up. Rather than a single throne,
four
elegantly carved chairs rest here behind a bench.

Long ago, before the Rose Rebellion, this impressive room was known as

room came to serve a different purpose, and has since been known as
Lord's
Hall. On the west side, stone arches surround beautiful casement
windows.
Large mirrors hang from the eastern wall opposite the windows, light
glittering off their silvered surface and gold leafed frames. A few
torches
on the wall cast light that shimmers and dances about as it burns. High
above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the
shining
colors and images of the knighthood faded and dull. On the south end,
the
red-carpeted floor takes a few steps up. Rather than a single throne,
four
elegantly carved chairs rest here behind a bench.

The Lord's Hall, once known as the Throne Room, is an impressive piece
of work. On the west side, stone arches surround beautiful casement
windows. Large mirrors hang from the eastern wall opposite the windows,
light glittering off their silvered surface and gold leafed frames. A
few
torches on the wall cast light that shimmers and dances about as it
burns.
High above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the
shinning colors and images of the knighthood faded and dull. The floor
is
covered with a red carpet that probably once was quite beautiful, but

their

appears
to be the base of a tower pushes out from the wall into the hallway,
its
curved side narrowing the point of passage and providing an excellent
internal defense point. An open doorway leads east to the turret.
