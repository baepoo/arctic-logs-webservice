I love this log... haha :)

Western City Gates
You are inside the western city gates. The gates are made of thick
wood, reinforced with iron bars, and are very tough to break. The
gateway
is arched, and above you you can see steel bars that can slide down in
case
of siege or attack.
Icen the Male Half Elf is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
. . . is surrounded by a shimmering light.
Alex the Female High Elf is standing here. (flying)
Lord Feroz, Bashing His Way Into Your Soul is resting here. (flying)
A street cleaner is walking about, cleaning up the trash.
A cityguard of Kalaman stands here, guarding the western gates.
