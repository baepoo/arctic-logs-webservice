Oscarr rips due to bad luck on his part.

You tell your group 'lets kill everyone near gargath'

Entrance to Gargath's Keep
There is a series of steps leading to a marble platform. Two tall
marble columns support a bronze roof. There is a large bronze door to
the
west. To the east you see a dusty trail.
A heavy iron gorget is lying on the ground here
Tikk Tock, Nobody's Timekeeper is standing here. (flying)
Oscarr the Male Theiwar Dwarf is resting here. (flying)
. . . is followed by a hovering ball of light.
A Gargathian guard is standing here, doing his job.
Gargath's guard is sitting here.
341H 76V 5440755X 0C Exits:NES(W)> back oscarr
Oscarr makes a strange sound, as you place a ruby inlaid dagger in his
back.
341H 76V 5440755X 0C [Me:V.Good] [Oscarr:Awful] Exits:NES(W)>
You pierce Oscarr extremely hard.
341H 76V 5440755X 0C [Me:V.Good] [Oscarr:Awful] Exits:NES(W)>
Tikk rolls on the floor in a fit of laughter.
341H 76V 5440755X 0C [Me:V.Good] [Oscarr:Awful] Exits:NES(W)> flee
flee
flee
You massacre Oscarr with your pierce.
Oscarr is mortally wounded, and will die soon, if not aided.
PANIC! You couldn't escape!
341H 76V 5440755X 0C [Me:V.Good] [Oscarr:Dying] Exits:NES(W)> You flee
head over heels.
Oscarr lies suffering on the ground till no blood is left in his body.
You receive 0 experience.
Oscarr is dead! R.I.P.
Path Around the Tower
This path seem to be rather well-worn from much use. The tower looms
above you to the west and the forest stretches out eastward. You see
the
path turn around a corner to the south, and the entrance to Gargath's
Keep
is back northward.
341H 74V 5440755X 0C Exits:NS> Your blood freezes as you hear someone's
death cry.
You're not fighting, why bother fleeing?
