Lord's Hall
The Lord's Hall, once known as the Throne Room, is an impressive piece
of work. On the west side, stone arches surround beautiful casement
windows. Large mirrors hang from the eastern wall opposite the windows,
light glittering off their silvered surface and gold leafed frames. A
few
torches on the wall cast light that shimmers and dances about as it
burns.
High above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the
shinning colors and images of the knighthood faded and dull. The floor
is
covered with a red carpet that probably once was quite beautiful, but
is
now faded and worn as well.

Before the Throne Room
The hallway comes to and end here at a massive, beautifully detailed
set of oak doors. The doors, while still quite nice, must have been
spectacular in the past. The gold highlights of the carvings of knights
in
battle and the images of the Knighthood have been worn, or possibly
scraped
away. Stone walls border you to the south and east, rising high up to
the
vaulted ceiling. The rest of the hallway extends north past the
turrets.

The Lord's Hall, once known as the Throne Room, is an impressive piece
of work. On the west side, stone arches surround beautiful casement
windows. Large mirrors hang from the eastern wall opposite the windows,
light glittering off their silvered surface and gold leafed frames. A
few
torches on the wall cast light that shimmers and dances about as it
burns.
High above you, threadbare banners hang down from the peaked roof, the
shinning colors and images of the knighthood faded and dull. The floor
is
covered with a red carpet that probably once was quite beautiful, but
is
now faded and worn as well.
