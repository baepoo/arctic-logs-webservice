A Junction of Paths
The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The
northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving
only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains
towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

Banks of the Vingaard River
You are standing on the northern banks of the Vingaard river. The
roaring river flows past you, splashing water near your feet. The river
appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As
you
survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from
the
river there is a path heading north.
