Shallow Waters
Much as you would expect, very few fishermen frequent these waters,
and those that do must be quite desperate to risk life and limb this far
away from civilization. The water here is calm, and fish can be seen
darting beneath the blood-red tinted waters. To the west lies a small
natural bay. Eastward lies more of the waters of the Blood Sea, named after
the myth that the sea is red with the blood of the innocents who died
during the Cataclysm.
