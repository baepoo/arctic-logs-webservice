YOU CAST -----------> relocate
Kingfisher Way North
You stand upon a firm, well-made cobblestone street in the northern
part of Tantallon. This portion of the street deviates slightly from
the
norm; instead of buildings on both sides, there is only one to the
west.
Glancing to the east, you see what appears to be a stockpile of waste
and
junk, and the terrible odor coming from that direction confirms your
thoughts. The building to the west appears to have been vacated by its
owner, as there is a "For Sale" sign in the front window. Given the
close
proximity to the town dump, it's not hard to figure out why nobody
wants to
live there.
Jeremiah Saint, Devil May Cry is sitting here. (flying)
. . . is surrounded by 4 duplicate images.
