Ahmed flies down.
Nihilism flies down.
Mastiff leaves down.
Kow flies down.
You follow Ahmed down.
The noise level increases dramatically as you climb down to the tavern
below.
The Crashing Boar Inn
This is a small, comfortable inn in the northern part of Tantallon. The
walls are composed of large round stones cemented together. On the
western
wall is a large fireplace which provides ample light and heat to the
room.
Several round tables are spread about the area, and numerous patrons
sit
around them, chatting merrily as they enjoy their food and ale. A large
bar
sits in the northern part of the room, and numerous patrons are seated
on
stools in front of it, enjoying the local specialty or a steaming hot
meal.
On the far side of the inn, a large set of stairs leads upwards.
A bulletin board covered with notes has been mounted on the western
wall.
Kow Bell, Clanging Victory of the Blood Sea Pirates is standing here.

Mastiff leaves east.
Kow flies east.
You follow Ahmed east.
Kingfisher Way North
The street you walk on has been cobbled with utmost precision, leaving
not a single gap between the stones. Extending to both the north and
the
south, Kingfisher Way is one of the busiest streets in Tantallon, and
the
home of most of the stores in town. You see the town square lying close
by
to the south, while to the north you can see the street continuing into
the
distance towards the northern outskirts of the town. A lot of noise is
coming from an inn to the west, and to the east you see a building with
a
sign marking it as the Tantallon tannery.
A long sword lies on the ground.

Kingfisher Way North
You stand upon a firm, well-made cobblestone street in the northern
part of Tantallon. This portion of the street deviates slightly from
the
norm; instead of buildings on both sides, there is only one to the
west.
Glancing to the east, you see what appears to be a stockpile of waste
and
junk, and the terrible odor coming from that direction confirms your
thoughts. The building to the west appears to have been vacated by its
owner, as there is a "For Sale" sign in the front window. Given the
close
proximity to the town dump, it's not hard to figure out why nobody
wants to
live there.
A dark longsword has been dropped here.
The corpse of Fer is lying here.
A single steel coin lies here. [3]

You stand upon a firm, well-made cobblestone street in the northern
part of Tantallon. This portion of the street deviates slightly from
the
norm; instead of buildings on both sides, there is only one to the
west.
Glancing to the east, you see what appears to be a stockpile of waste
and
junk, and the terrible odor coming from that direction confirms your
thoughts. The building to the west appears to have been vacated by its
owner, as there is a "For Sale" sign in the front window. Given the
close
proximity to the town dump, it's not hard to figure out why nobody
wants to
live there.

Though most of this street is rather crowded by Tantallonian standards,
the farther north you go, the more tranquil and quiet Kingfisher Way
becomes. To the east is a typical, expensive Tantallonian residential
building. However, to the west is a large brick building that you
identify
as the town jail. Kingfisher Way continues both north and south from
here,
and a small entryway leads into the jail to the west.
An elderly woman slowly strolls through the streets of the town.

Kingfisher Way North
The stone street you stand upon has been skillfully cobbled by dwarven
artisans, rumored to have been hired from the far-off mountain of
Thorbardin. To both the east and west are magnificent, expensive homes
and
shops that look as if they were snatched right off the pages of a
storybook. The street is not very crowded; aside from an occaisonal
citizen
walking by on his way home or to a store, as well as a few guards that
stroll through on patrol, you can't see any other signs of life.
However,
the emptiness is somehow more peaceful than eerie.

Northern Entrance to Tantallon
The city walls part here to allow the road to flow through them, though
there is no gate barring traffic to and from Tantallon. Looking north,
you
can see the reason: the only thing there is a huge castle. Tantallon
Keep,
as it is called, is owned by a powerful Solamnic Knight by the name of
Lord
Curston. The fortress keeps a close watch over the region, ensuring
that no
evil can penetrate the town. Small deserted roads branch off to the
east
and west. To the south is Tantallon itself, while a cobbled path leads
north to the keep.

The cobblestone path is about the width of the northern gate, providing
ample space for a brigade of foot soldiers to march to or from the
keep. It
leads straight north to the large fortress just a few steps ahead of
you.

Crossing the Bridge
The sturdy wooden bridge has been built from long planks of durable
pinewood, and is held together by thick, blackened iron bands that
stretch
horizontally across the bridge. Huge iron chains extend from the end of
the
bridge to reels within the castle walls, used to control the
drawbridge,
though from the rustiness of the links, it seems there has not been
reason
to close it for many years.

The Southern Portcullis
The massive fortress known as Tantallon Keep fills your entire field of

entrance to the keep from enemies. Far above on the battlements,
vigilant
archers pace back and forth on their patrols. Realistic stone statues
of
soldiers, designed to mislead enemy scouts into overestimating the
keep's
garrison, line the battlements. A large wooden drawbridge leads south
across the moat towards the town of Tantallon on the other side.
