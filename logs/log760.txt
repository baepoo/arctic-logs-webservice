The large desert like area known as the tarsis wastelands rise before
you to the east, once a nomans land of thieves and prostitutes, they
now
serve as an uninhabited boundary for the ruins of old Tarsis. A trail
leads
off to the north into a thick forest of ancient trees that climb high
into
the air. The path to the south leads into a dense swamp filled with
thick
vegetation and unbearable humidity.

The humid air of the swamp just to the south is thick, and smells of
rotting plant life. Thick vines and deformed trees grow up out of the
murky
waters of the swamp, creating walls of vegetation. To the north the
western
gates of Old Tarsis stand at the end of the path.

field
around you is full of green and vibrant grass, and while it is fresh
and
alive, it is also very, very damp. The path continues on a north south

You stand on a small path before a great swamp which rises from the

the ground, and the aroma of the flowers begins to have a soporific
