A Poor Commoner's Dwelling
This house is little more than walls with a roof overhead. There is
almost nothing in the way of furnishings, and the walls are quite bare.
The people here seem content with what they have however, and feel
happy
about working hard to gain more, instead of resorting to less lawful
means.
A small chest is tucked away in a corner.
A hill giant is roaming around looking for something to kill.
o giant bash KojiKoji, a Kender of Ill-Repute is standing here.
(flying)
A poor commoner prepares the evening meal.
