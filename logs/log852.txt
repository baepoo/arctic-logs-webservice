POV: Mienoshma

Log Rating: -2.7368

Poor Limper had a bad day.... it just got worse

Mienoshma the young adult female high elf is in an excellent condition.
<held in secondary hand> a small bag of flash powder
23H 118V 2499X 0C Mem:1 Exits:S>
You wave a small bag of flash powder.
A fireball released from your bag envelopes a curious kender in flames.
A hoopak in use by a curious kender is destroyed.
You are enveloped in flames from a fireball, which appears out of
nowhere.
That Really did HURT!
A fireball released from your bag envelopes Tyrol in flames.
A fireball released from your bag envelopes Limper in flames.
A merchant amulet in use by Limper is destroyed.
A fireball released from your bag envelopes an attractive mercenary in
flames.
The fireball discharged by your bag does not seem to affect Petrin.
As the usefulness of a small bag of flash powder ends, it suddenly
disappears.

Exits:S>
Tyrol boggles at some nebulous concept.

Exits:S>
An attractive mercenary massacres YOU with her pierce.
You are mortally wounded, and will die soon, if not aided.
Someone obliterates YOU with their slash.
You're dead.
The air around you loses its solidity.
You suddenly notice that your body is in focus once again.
