Buki vs Dragor the Level 2 Warrior (with a little Padme/Ender help)

POV: Ender

Log Rating: 2.5652

This is from Ender's POV. Deula and Buki decide to kill Dagor, a level
2 warrior. So Ender and I decide to give them a taste of their own
medicine. The convo in the log is hilarious, one of the funnier things
I've been involved in this wipe. Enjoy! Not shown in log is Pyrxx dying
twice to me after attempting to kill Dragor.
