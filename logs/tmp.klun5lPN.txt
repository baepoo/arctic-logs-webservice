military conquests and victories.  In the center of the room is a large
table. The table is directly carved from the mountain, giving the room a
strange look to it.  On the table sits a small oil lamp and several maps
and papers.

The Hall of Kings
Unlike the rough halls of the city above, the halls here are quite
smooth. A lot of time was spent by the dwarves here to remove all the rough
edges and stoney fissure that made travel in the tunnels above sometimes
hard.  The tunnel can be considered more of a hall; its tall, square shape
is a welcome sight to you.  Several torches are embedded along the wall,
radiating a large quantity of light.  Every once-in-a-while a statue has
been carved into the walls of the hall.  The statues are quite detailed.
A necklace made of small fragments of crystal is lying here...it glows dimly
A small roll of bread lies here. [9]
