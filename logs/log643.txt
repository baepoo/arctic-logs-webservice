A Slimy Lair
The cold stone walls are very damp and glisten from your light source.
Small patches of decayed cloth lie on the floor, along with a limb or

The foul smell is enough to make even the most hardened warrior wretch.
The
claw marks come to an abrupt end and there appears to be a word weakly
scratched into the floor.

Open Courtyard
You are in an open paved courtyard. To the east stands four tall
free-standing columns that support nothing; the building lies in ruins
around them. A huge unbroken circular stone wall rises about four feet
above the ground. Looking down through the center you discover that is
a
well...a deep well at that...and smells very bad. A great feeling of
fear
permeates your soul as you look down into the well....you want to run
as
far as your legs can carry you.
The corpse of a draconian advance warrior is lying here.
