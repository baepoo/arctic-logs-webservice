The Bank of Balifor
The bank of Balifor looks fairly rundown. Not surprising, since the
local populace doesn't earn enough money to bother putting it in banks.
Still, the bank teller, shuttered up behind a reinforced glass window and
door, looks enthusiastic enough. A small sign has been stuck to the desk.

The Practice Yard
Different groups of fighters have taken over this fragment of old
courtyard. Along the east side, rangers have set up archery butts and
practice their bandaging skills on each other. Along the west, paladins
practice bashing each other with wooden shields. Fencing dummies are
mounted on posts in the center of the yard and warriors hone their skills
with a variety of blades.

You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it

The Tavern Square
Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.
