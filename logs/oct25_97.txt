Crossroad in the Valley
     You are standing on a crossroad filled with tracks of wagon and foot

traffic, heading in all directions. The road seems to be man-made, judging

from the soft dirt packed into the earth, which indicates the ground 
has

been dug up sometime in the near past. The shadow of an ancient structure

high above looms over you, and gives you the chills when thinking what has

occupied that place since ancient times of the knights. In the far distance

to the north, you can see what appears to be an area filled with

vegetation. The road continues to the east and west heading up and around

both mountains. To the south lies a small forested area.

Tayla flies south.
You follow Tayla south.
Thick Copse of Trees
     Traveling along a small game trail, you work your way slowly through

the tightly packed forest of ancient pine trees. Most light is blocked out

by the thick canopy of tree limbs, making the trek dark and eerie. 
Just

enough of your light penetrates the thick stands of trees to play tricks on

Your eyes. you imagine seeing shapes dart in and out of the shadows,

waiting and watching you. The trail leads further north into the 
woods.

A waterskin is lying here.

The corpse of Kavoren is lying here.

The corpse of Murky is lying here.
