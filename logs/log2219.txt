Unknown Hunting Target Ryo
********************************************
Deep Mine Main Way
In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall,
however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the
tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to
the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to
the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in
that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.
Torches set near the ceiling, brighten this residential area.

This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south.
A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the
main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches
for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to

Vingaard's immense iron gates stand directly to the north, where they
present a significant obstacle to any attacking force, but currently
they
have been raised high to allow passage of people and horses. High stone
walls run east and west from here, extending quite a ways before
turning
beyond your vision. A road heads south where it quickly turns and heads
west, passing the toll station as it travels through fields of grain,
and a
cobblestone avenue heads north through the gates.

This large tunnel, just behind the keep's gates, travels through the
thick stone walls. The ceiling above you is curved and supported by
several
small arches, and two great arches stand on either end of this tunnel
where
they lead out into openness. The road's pavement is made of smooth,
gray
cobblestones about the size of your fist. Torches mounted on iron
brackets
provide almost all of the light for the tunnel. The air seems
relatively
stagnant throughout the tunnel, and mixes only with the fresh outside
air
at the ends. The cobblestone road heads north into the town of

side. A faint smell of smoke mixed with various other aromas can be
sensed
in the air, apparently coming from the chimneys of the nearby houses.

and
worn. Despite this, they still fit snuggly together and feel stable as
they
are traversed. The road heads north where Vingaard's central park is
