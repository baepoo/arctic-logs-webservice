The Harpers have received 71 email messages in the last 24 hours to the
"Come be Slaughtered for Vasagh" rally.  After many months of hard, risky,
dangerous work, I managed to get a sleeper into the Harpers, and he
forwarded me the following information at great risk of life and limb ...
here's a log:

Vasagh here, I know we're doing the right thing! Long live the struggle!

DOH, half our clan died in our first big fight.  This is Vasagh.  Maybe
we're not really doing the right thing?  Hrm. Let's just go do the easy
parts of Drow and Graknar 10 times because that's all I can lead and we'll
think about it. Damnit, why won't my face rippers ever load!

Welcome to the Rage Auxilliary, you guys!  I just know over the next 17
wipes as we bravely and valiantly hide in the inn, we're going to get to
know all kinds of really neat things about each other!  And by the way, if
you get the chance PLEASE KILL CARIS, he made me cry and wet myself last
night.  Thanks!  Oh, and I can stay up pretty darn late too, once mommy
turns the red light on, I usually don't see her and my daily daddy again
until the next mornin!  Oh and by the way, if you need to talk to me talk
to my multi Kefka ... hahaha, the Shriners thought I was Kefka, but I told
them I wasn't! HAHAHA, I'm so sneaky!  And the Shriners are so stoooopid!
Hahahahaa!

Vasagh here once more, ok, so maybe making decisions while freebasing crack
was a bad idea.  But we're stuck with it now, so I'm going to start
lobbying to get the price of bronze equipment and plain long swords cut in
half so we can still mud.  Err, long live the strugg --- ahh, fuck it.  RUN
FOR YOUR LIFE!
