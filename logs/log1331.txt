Aldur flies in from the west.
A hill giant arrives from the west.
A Short Alley
A stench has come to rest in this small path, a stench that is
uncommonly rank. The smell of fish permeates the air and dominates all
thoughts. The cobblestones underfoot are part of a small alley between
a
building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish
market
to the east. Piles of disgarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.
A hill giant is roaming around looking for something to kill.
Aldur A'kul, Ancient Blood Sea Champion of the Abyss is standing here.

Looking south:
A large pile of dead fish has been pushed against the city wall.
Looking west:
The sounds and smells of the dockyards are quite clear from the west.
Looking up:
A torch hangs from the city wall, illuminating the alley.
Looking down:
The cobblestones below are covered in fish guts and smelly sea water.
