On the Shores of Nevermind
     You check your surroundings, and quickly realize that you are in an
area of Krynn that you have never truly experienced before. A warm sun
sooths your skin and gentle waves lap against a running shoreline. A pure
vanilla white sand stretches all around, and up to the edge of a nearby
bar and jacuzzi. An island band is playing some calypso nearby, soothing
your aching head and helping you forget some of your troubles. The
bartender looks eager to please, and patiently waits for your next order.
A large chalkboard is wedged here between two palms.
Sir Leirin Castlegrad, Knight of Solamnia is standing here. (white aura)
Aristox, the Ancient Plague is standing here.
