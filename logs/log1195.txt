Traders Square
This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from
wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going
distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead
away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.
A rotted and moldy acorn sits on the ground.
A lock of hair lays upon the ground.
