The Solace Adventurer's Guild
The guild is full of adventurers of all types, who are trying to hone
and perfect their skills. The walls are covered with racks of weapons
and
armour that are used in the training. Huge book cases also fill the
room,
containing numerous spell books and scrolls. There are even chests and
doors that seem to be made specifically for practice by thieves and
their
lockpicks. One master of all skills oversees all the training and
progression here. A small stairway leads down out of the tree and to
