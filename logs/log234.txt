Phaon flies south.
You follow Huuz south.
A Small Dais
You stand upon a small stone altar, off of the hallway. Dust lies
thick upon the ground. You can see the roots of the trees, from the
hillside above poking the roof high above and the odd piece of dirt
falls
to the floor. There is a large statue standing in a small alcove in the
far corner of the room.
A large altar stands here behind the statue.
A mace lies discarded on the ground.
A dark green candlestick burns softly in the corner of the room.
You sense a life form.
