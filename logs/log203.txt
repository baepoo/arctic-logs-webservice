Southern Avenue
Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern
has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. You also notice a
small
stairway which spirals down around the trunk of the vallenwood. The
avenue
also leads north and south into other parts of Solace.
