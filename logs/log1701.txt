Arctic's History of Warfare

POV: Yair

Log Rating: 2.9501

A brief glimpse at Arctic's clan warfare history.

Arctic: History of Warfare - a quick summary
--------------------------
One method of dividing such as massive topic is by cutting it into
periods of time.
While useful, this method tends to be inaccurate and differences in
clans mean there is little uniformity.
What might be described as ancient warfare is still practiced by a
number of clans on Arctic.
-Prehistoric warfare: Warfare before the development of feature-packed
clients and fast links.
-Ancient warfare: Primarily infantry warfare (in large amounts) in the
era before the fast links.
-Medieval warfare: Area spells dominate after the inflation of book
loads but are displaced because of increasing numbers of changes in
zones and finally, the remaking of the book load system.
-Gunpowder warfare: Infantry and artillery work in unison.
-Industrial warfare: Faster computers, links and clients greatly change
the face of warfare.
-Modern warfare: Rapid links and communications, increased automation,
relying heavily on intelligence. Commando tactics and Guerrilla warfare
outrank classic warfare.
Another method of dividing this topic is by type of war:
Trench Warfare
--------------
This is the most basic form of warfare on Arctic. Trench warfare is a
form of war in which both opposing
clans have lines of fortifications dug into the ground, facing each
other.
Siege Warfare
-------------
A siege is a prolonged military blockade and assault of a clan with the
intent of defeating by force or
attrition. A siege occurs when an attacker encounters a clan that
refuses to surrender and cannot be easily
taken by a frontal assault (the members stay in rent). Sieges usually
involve staying online for a long period
of time and blocking the opposing clan's zoning time, typically coupled
with buff tanks, and a clairing mage.
Asymmetric Warfare
------------------
-Asymmetric warfare is a military term describing warfare in which the
two belligerents are mismatched
in their military capabilities or their accustomed methods of
engagement. In such a situation the militarily
disadvantaged power must press its special advantages or effectively
exploit its enemy's particular
weaknesses if the disadvantaged power is to have any hope of
prevailing.
The tactical success of asymmetric warfare is dependent on at least
some of the following assumptions:
-One side can have better eq and spells which outweighs the numerical
advantage of the enemy; the decisive
BSP Power Word Stun is an example. The advantage may be the other way
around. For example, the vast numerical
superiority of the BSP forces during their final fight in the
BSP-Outlaw War last wipe overwhelmed the
eq and spell superiority of the Outlaw forces.
-If the inferior power is in a position of self-defense; i.e., under
constant attack and harassment, it may
be possible to use unconventional tactics, such as luring the enemy
into traps and selective battles where
the superior power is weaker, as an effective means of harassment
without violating the Laws of war.
Variations of this tactic succeeded for the WildRunners and its allied
forces in the Wild-BSP war four wipes
ago, in that the Wild forces played on BSP's inward political situation
and their cockiness to go into battle.
The use of terrain in asymmetric warfare
----------------------------------------
Terrain can be used as a force multiplier by the smaller force and as a
force inhibitor against the stronger
force. Many clans like to include the use of traps and zone features in
their fighting repertoire. One
victorious battle can change the direction of a war easily (for
detailed examples see 'The Battle in Ancient
Keep' and 'The Battle of Bluff').
Morality of asymmetric warfare
------------------------------
In the classic rules of war asymmetric warfare is completely moral in
and of itself, all other rules of war
being obeyed. This entails:
-Neutrals cannot be attacked (thus randoming is outlawed)
-The war is a properly declared war, with an accountable authority on
both sides who can also put an end
to the war.
Guerrilla Warfare
-----------------
-Guerrilla warfare is one of the oldest forms of asymmetric warfare.
Guerrilla tactics are based on
intelligence, ambush, deception, sabotage, and espionage, and their
ultimate objective is usually to
destabilize an authority through long, low-intensity confrontation.
Guerrilla warfare is not to be confused with commando tactics utilized
by organized clans. The basic
profiles of a Guerrilla fighter is a member of a dying clan which still
wants to exact his revenge on the
opposing forces or a profound and skilled randomer (see Corey the Fat -
wipe 10, for more details).
Summary
-------
As the methods of warfare evolve we can see a decaying number of pk
activities between clans. Players who
are pk-driven find themselves bored easily these past wipes, while
people who are zone-driven may find the
game a bit more enjoyable.
Some may claim that Arctic's warfare has reached its peak, i do not
dare to agree.
One thing is sure: If things continue the way they are today, Arctic's
clan warfare will never return to its
glory.
