Southern Avenue and The Avenue of the Triumvirate
The cobblestone lanes of Southern Avenue and The Avenue of the
Triumvirate intersect here. The edifices along the northern side of the
Avenue of the Triumvirate are larger and grander than the buildings
along
the southern side, apparently because they serve a greater function
than
the houses that populate the street on the south side. The famed Temple
of
Paladine stands to the northeast, and another large stone building
stands
to the northwest. The central park is visible a bit to the north.

The Avenue of the Triumvirate
Many houses of Vingaard's middle-class families stand on the north and
south sides of this road as it passes east-west through the
southwestern
section of Vingaard. Most of the houses are made of stone, and are one
to
two stories tall. Short stone paths lead to the wooden front doors of
the
houses, with a few plants along its sides. Entrance to nearly all of
the
houses is prevented by gates that have been locked and barred, except
to
the south where the gate stands open. An array of small plants grows in
the
garden to the south, and the house appears to belong to a herbalist.
The corpse of a wizard eye is lying here.
