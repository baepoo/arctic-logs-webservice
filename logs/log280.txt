Elyana vs. Hyperion - Part Two

POV: Hyperion

Log Rating: 1.3637

Jolrael and I had laid a Cunning Trap for Elyana in a nomagic room.
Unfortunately we overestimated ourselves and the victims became the
victors.

The Secret Compartment
Hidden behind the loose panels of Erlac's wagon lies a hidden
compartment that Erlac must have used to store his wealth. The room is
undecorated and looks very plain. The size of the room forces you to
bend
slightly upon entering so that you can fit into it. To the west, the
loose
panels open out into the larger room of the wagon.
A merchants silver chest stands here.
Jolrael the Male Goblin is standing here. (flying)
. . . is outlined with a glittery dust.
A well travelled mercenary, hired to protect the merchants stands here.
