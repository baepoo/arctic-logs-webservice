look is an image of your group and you find yourself talking to a
reflection instead of a real person.
Gorre Tohz is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
Lady Keila Stormborn, Five-Headed Failure of Mysidia is standing here.

fall face down.

You wither as a ray of sunlight engulfs you!
You have been blinded!
