A Cobbled Lane
The lane leads north-south, into the quiet and strange town. There is a
small sign here, making you aware of the inn nearby. To the east lies
the
only stretch of greenery in Neraka - once. What was obviously a small
park
has been ruthlessly burnt, signs of campfires and tent markings suggest
that a draconian camp has once been here.

Nearing the town crossroads, the buildings get bigger and seemingly

white-wash. The sounds of breaking wood can be heard from the inn to

You are at the very centre of this foul town. Crossroads lead to all

of
Takhisis, Queen of Darkness. From the north comes the sound of drinking
and
merriment, the town's local inn.
A stone fountain with an ugly draconian water statue stands here.

The Seedy Inn
The blood stained floor is evident as soon as you enter. No attempt has
been made to hide last night's brawl. Obviously, such violence is
commonplace. Looking around, the locals hiss at you and sneer back into
their watered ale. A long bar, once made from fine oak, stands against
the
far wall. The many ales are displayed in their kegs in a corner.
Jeering
and shouts can be heard from the backroom to the north.
A large bulletin board is mounted on a wall here.
Holly the barwoman is here, flaunting her body and eager to serve.

The Reception
Although this inn does not look very reputable, at least it has warm
beds and anyhow, it is safer than sleeping in the streets of Neraka. A
small counter stands here with a little brass bell, although you should
not
use it for fear that the receptionist gets angry. It looks as if she
has
had a hard day already.
The receptionist sits here, looking very flustered.
Standing in shadows, a draconian guard hisses occasionally.

Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high

You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to
form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and
hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at
the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here.

Death Row
Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark
and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are
boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is
nicknamed
'Death Row'.

Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A
dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street
and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp
on
the tavern wall.

You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in
the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit
and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to
the
west is a meeting room.
