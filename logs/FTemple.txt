Inside the Solamnic Ruins
     Before you stretches a vision from darkest nightmare. The quiet stone
hallway leading deeper into the volcano was obviously once the entrance to
a majestic temple devoted to the patron gods of the Solamnic Orders, but
there is something very wrong here. Crimson splashes of blood coat the
walls and floor, filling the air with a sickening smell. The once-beautiful
carvings lining the ceiling have been defaced and broken, and rubble
crunches under your boots.
Lari Wild, Lady Larceny is standing here.
Likera is standing here.
Prater, Natural WildRunner is standing here.
Jeter, Wild Wizard is standing here. (flying)
.. . . is enveloped in flames.
You see the outline of a life form here, carrying: a pair of black taloned gauntlets; a bracelet of dragon teeth; a rapier of treated steel.
Haplo Nar, Wild Style is standing here. (invisible)
Blood covering his torn body, a Solamnic Knight lies here moaning.

Stairs to the Temple
     Massive doors, each standing well over thirty feet high, have been
carved into the solid rock of the mountainside before you. Flanked on
either side by stone pillars stretching towards the skies, you can see the
telltale signs that this portal indeed opens, but you see no latch or
handle, just a small indentation carved into the western door.

Stairs to the Temple
     The perfectly sculpted marble stairs stretch upwards majestically to a
set of massive stone doors carved into the volcano face. Beneath your feet,
the sticky crimson stains of shed blood bask in tepid weather, sending a
sickly sweet smell past your nostrils. You notice several nicks and gashes
in the otherwise smooth stone face of the stairs as well, indicating that a
mighty battle was fought here recently.

overgrown gardens, a massive set of marble stairs directly in front of you
extends upward into an entrance carved into the sheer side of the volcano.
Rather than end in a dark cavern opening, however, the entire side of the
mountain has been carved to represent a massive temple, with towering stone
columns extending some one hundred feet high, and ending in an intricately
carved pediment.

     Now that you can see inside the barbican's walls, you realize that the
hands of no mortal could have crafted the temple before you. Surrounded by
overgrown gardens, a massive set of marble stairs directly in front of you
extends upward into an entrance carved into the sheer side of the volcano.
Rather than end in a dark cavern opening, however, the entire side of the
mountain has been carved to represent a massive temple, with towering stone
columns extending some one hundred feet high, and ending in an intricately
carved pediment.
