POV: Taloc

Log Rating: -0.6250

Kalon relocates to me thinking he can grab flameshield back and loses
some more spells. Keely wasnt enough.

After ripping to Keely on blood sea and losing flameshield on sheaf he
tries to relocate to me in hopes of claiming.
I almost didnt believe that he was that stupid, I had to scan and let
it soak in before I one stabbed it.
