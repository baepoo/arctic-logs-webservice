Fury had had internal problems, some people revolting and such, so
Vassili decided to use us as his hammer, which we gladly agreed. Most
our people got it that we should kill all Furies, ignoring Vassili's
"don't kill" lists in IRC. I was mostly content to warning certain
Furies to inned. 

After a bunch of random carnage, of which only part here, Vassili gets
really pissed because of us killing some of his friends too, and
starts forming group. I lead part of the group next to them there,
intended just to wait and see what happens (the last section of this log).
