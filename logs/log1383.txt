The Seedy Inn
The blood stained floor is evident as soon as you enter. No attempt has
been made to hide last night's brawl. Obviously, such violence is
commonplace. Looking around, the locals hiss at you and sneer back into
their watered ale. A long bar, once made from fine oak, stands against
the
far wall. The many ales are displayed in their kegs in a corner.
Jeering
and shouts can be heard from the backroom to the north.
A large bulletin board is mounted on a wall here.
Holly the barwoman is here, flaunting her body and eager to serve.

A Cobbled Lane
Nearing the town crossroads, the buildings get bigger and seemingly
better kept. The scorch marks have been replaced with a grubby shade of
white-wash. The sounds of breaking wood can be heard from the inn to
the
west. The center of town, the crossroads, lies to the south.
