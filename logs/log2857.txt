On a Vallenwood Tree Above Solace Square
The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the
boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures
have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its
charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a
neighboring
vallenwood tree.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here.
A Solace peacekeeper stands here, holding the peace.

On a Vallenwood Bough
The sturdy bough leads north and south. To the west, thick foliage from
the vallenwood tree hides whatever lies there giving you a sense of
dark
foreboding. To the east, a small rickety hut is built on the branch of
the
vallenwood tree.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here.
A plump housewife walks past carrying a basket full of groceries.

A beautiful vallenwood leaf falls to the ground.
On a Vallenwood Bough
The narrow bough comes to an end here. The new school of magic lies to
the west, while strange chanting can be heard from the north. A hut
built
from sewn patches of animal skins stretched across the vallenwood
branches
lie to the east. A small grove can be seen at the base of the tree, as
a
small branch slopes gently down from here providing passage. Finally,
the
bough moves back toward the trunk to the south.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here.

A Strange Hut
The hut is dimly lit by a sputtering candle sitting on a table. The
ground is covered with various animal skins that muffle the sound of
your
steps. A firepit sits in the center of the hut, the smoke escapes
through a
hole in the ceiling. Hanging on the walls are various bits of the
shaman's
craft - feathers, bones and containers of all sorts. An awful smell
emanates from a pot on the fire, you wonder if it is dinner or a
potion.
Foghorn, a bony man dressed in colorful rugs, is sitting here
cross-legged.

Solace Square
Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here.
A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.
