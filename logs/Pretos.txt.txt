Well now..isn't this just dandy.  A ragged group of half beaten and
shitty-linked soldiers claim victory over the rather offguard horde.
This log is a bit screwy cause I logged this with tintin and it wasnt
too friendly with the ansi settings...had to hand delete all the
garbage.  I still dont have a full list of our clan (ahem lucas}...so
email this around if needed.   Mystic is a badass place to war.  That
domed room can really screw you up if you get caught.  Anyway...our only
fatality was valan, and we got pretos and kurgath.  Then, tryin to
regroup past the domed room, they chased us around till we had to
recall. This log ends with me recalling, but apparantly the rest of em
got beat up by a bunch of casters and had to recall.  Cavron labatt
zyran and kalista were the only ones i think. That conick guy had some
nifty work in this one : )
Enjoy,
Mike/conick

P.S. Hey norman...you think MY saves were bad?
