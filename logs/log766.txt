You step aside as Kooz tries to bash you, causing him to tumble and
fall face down.

Uthgar smites YOU hard.

The yellowish-green cloud thins out.
Uthgar smites YOU hard.
Kooz stabs YOU extremely hard.
Woa stabs YOU extremely hard.
You smite Woa hard.

Uthgar focuses harshly on you and utters the words, 'harm'.
Someone grabs you. You scream as you feel your life-force being torn
away.
You're stunned, but will likely regain consciousness again.

Someone massacres YOU with their stab.
Twinkling lights surround you and cover your body entirely.
When they disappear, you find yourself somewhere else.
Lie still, you are dead.
You wish your wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!
