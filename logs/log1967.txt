Banks of the Vingaard River
You are standing on the northern banks of the Vingaard river. The
roaring river flows past you, splashing water near your feet. The river
appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As
you
survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from
the
river there is a path heading north.
