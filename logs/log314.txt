Bacal solos Quv and Grifin.

POV: Bacal

Log Rating: -1.0000

Slightly complex background to this log. Erand and I were running
around town after people, Quv and Grifin were doing the same - probably
after us. We were about to leave town when I lost link at the gates.
Reconnected to find Quv and Grifin following me (Erand's diplomacy at
work) so we quickly hatched a plan to beat them down without flags.
Worked flawlessly, with the exception of not having any containers so
Arshes got away with most of the loot. I lost link again right after
this, Erand saved my laggy ass and we managed to rent easy.
