The Tavern Square
Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A
dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street
and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp
on
the tavern wall.
