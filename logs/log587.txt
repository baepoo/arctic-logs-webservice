fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there
is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

To the north stands a rusty bronze gate, hanging slightly off its
hinges. Stretching to either side of it stands an old rickety fence
surrounding what appears to be a graveyard. To the east the trail leads
to
the western city gates of Kalaman, to the west it leads deeper into the
fields, and toward the river.

Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two
paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off
to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there
is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.
You feel a strong wind blowing here.

wooden walls rise up beside either side of the gate and block your view
of
Kalaman. Above the gate you can see Solamnic Knights on patrol on the
battlements. Off to the west you can see a trail leading through the
fields.

paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off
to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The
grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there
is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.
