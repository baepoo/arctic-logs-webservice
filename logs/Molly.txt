A Junction of Paths
     On the fringes of the great Solamnic Plains, you can see wave after
wave of foliage ruffling in the wind.  The road here branches off in
several directions.  Westward, the road winds its way through the plains
and eventually reaches Palanthas and the Turbious Ocean.  To the north, the
road heads towards Kalaman, a prosperous fishing town.  To the south, the
road continues through the barren wasteland of Krynn.  Several vultures and
other scavenger birds watch with interest as you decide where to go.
Karpanen, an Ahmadian Buzzer is standing here. (flying) (invisible)
