Uxi R.I.P.

POV:

Log Rating: 0.0000

Uxi betrayed us when we were going to play with a friend of his, so I
logged on to RIP it.

The Solace Armor Emporium
This small shop is filled with all types of armors and shields. The
selection ranges from pristine suits of full plate, to bits and pieces
of
leather and splint mail. It appears as though anything you need can be
found here. A small stairway leads down towards the clearing below.

The Southern Gate
This gate protects Solace from invaders from the south. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and the gate is placed
between
these. The forest to the south looks much wilder and dangerous than the
forest that houses Solace. Southern Avenue leads north into Solace
itself.

dense
canopy of the forest. As you walk among the forest life, you feel safe
and
at ease. You see a large stone building to the east. The avenue
continues
to the north and south. A small sign is posted here.

Southern Avenue
You are on a rather wide road. This avenue leads south and north
through the town. To the north, you see buildings built up in the limbs
of
the huge vallenwoods. This view of Solace shows you how much the
village
depends on the ancient trees for life and sustenance. The avenue leads
north and south.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here...it glows dimly
A stray dog slowly moves about the area, sniffing the nearby trees.
